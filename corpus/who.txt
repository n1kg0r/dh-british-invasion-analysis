I don't mind your love
I don't mind the one you're thinkin' of
I know, I know
You gonna miss me

I don't mind your love so sound
I don't mind, it can't go cold
I know, I know
You gonna miss me

I don't mind, it's the end of my song
I don't mind, good-bye, so long
I know, said, baby I know
You gonna miss me


I know when I've had enough
When I think your love is rough

[chorus:]
The good's gone
The good's gone
The good's gone
The good's gone
The good's gone out of our love
I know it's wrong
We should enjoy it, but
The good's gone
The good's gone

Once we used to get along
Now, each time we kiss, it's wrong

[chorus]

Now it ain't no fun
And the good's gone now
We used to love as one
But we have forgotten now

I know when I've had enough
When I think your love is rough

[chorus]

It's gone forever


If I'm so lost without a friend
Tell me, who's this by my side?
This girl with eyes like gems
And cool reactions to your lies
Lies
La la la la la la lies

You can't repeat what you put 'round
All the things that made me cry
You kicked me when I was down
And they hurt me all those lies
Lies
La la la la la la lies

I've got my girl and together we're strong
To laugh at you and prove you wrong

I don't insist that you feel bad
I just want to see you smile
Don't ever think you made me mad
I didn't listen to your lies
Lies
La la la la la la lies

If I'm so lost without a friend
Tell me, who's this by my side?
This girl with eyes like gems
And cool reactions to your lies
Lies
La la la la la la lies

I don't insist that you feel bad
I just want to see you smile
Don't ever think you made me mad
I didn't listen to your lies
Lies
La la la la la la lies


Much too much to bear

Your love is hard and fast
Your love will always last
If it's you I need
I've got to pay the levy
Got to pay
'Cause your love's too heavy on me

And it's much too much to bear

If I ever leave you darlin'
I hope you see
That I really love you
But your love's too heavy on me

And it's much too much to bear

When I make love to you
Do all the things you want me to do
You never think of me
Always cry a bevy
Bevy of tears
'Cause your love's too heavy on me

And it's much too much to bear

There was a time I could give all I had to you
But my enthusiasm waned and I can't bear the pain
Of doing what I don't want to do

Much too much to bear

Your love is hard and fast
Your love will always last
If it's you I need
I've got to pay the levy
Got to pay
'Cause your love's too heavy on me

And it's much too much to bear

I don't mind other guys dancing with my girl
That's fine, I know them all pretty well
But I know sometimes I must get out in the light
Better leave her behind with the kids, they're alright
The kids are alright

Sometimes, I feel I gotta get away
Bells chime, I know I gotta get away
And I know if I don't, I'll go out of my mind
Better leave her behind with the kids, they're alright
The kids are alright

I know if I go things would be a lot better for her
I had things planned, but her folks wouldn't let her

I don't mind other guys dancing with my girl
That's fine, I know them all pretty well

Sometimes, I feel I gotta get away
Bells chime, I know I gotta get away
And I know if I don't, I'll go out of my mind

It's not true

You say I've been in prison
You say I've got a wife
You say I've had help doing
Everything throughout my life

[chorus:]
It's not true, it's not true
I'm telling you
'Cause I'm up here and you're nowhere
It's not true, so there

I haven't got eleven kids
I weren't born in Baghdad
I'm not half-Chinese either
And I didn't kill my dad

[chorus]

If you hear more rumors
You can just forget them too
Fools start the rumors
None of them are true

[chorus]

You say I've been in prison
You say I've got a wife
You say I've had help doing
Everything throughout my life

I haven't got eleven kids
I weren't born in Baghdad
I'm not half-Chinese either
And I didn't kill my dad

[chorus]

I told you why I changed my mind
I got bored by playing with time
I know you thought you had me nailed
But I've freed my head from your garden rails

Now it's a legal matter, baby
You got me on the run
It's a legal matter, baby
A legal matter from now on

My mind's lost in a household fog
Wedding gowns and catalogs
Kitchen furnishings and houses
Maternity clothes and baby's trousers

Now it's a legal matter, baby
Marryin's no fun
It's a legal matter, baby
A legal matter from now on

I told you why I changed my mind
I got bored by playing with time
I know you thought you had me nailed
Well, I've freed my head from your garden rails

Now it's a legal matter, baby
You got me on the run
It's a legal matter, baby
A legal matter from now on

You ain't the first and you ain't the last
I gain and lose my women fast
I never want to make them cry
I just get bored, don't ask me why

Just wanna keep doing all the dirty little things I do
And not work all day in an office just to bring my money back to you
Sorry, baby


Circles, my head is going round in circles
My mind is caught up in a whirlpool
Dragging me down

Time will tell if I'll take the homeward track
Dizziness will make my feet walk back
Walk right back to you

[chorus:]
Everything I do, I think of you
No matter how I try, I can't get by
These circles, leading me back to you

Round and around and around and around and around
and around and around and around and around

And round and round like a fool I go
Down and down in the pool I go
Dragging me down

[chorus]

There one thing could kill the pain of losing you
But it gets me so dizzy then I'm walking right back again
Back to you

Time will tell if these dreams are nearly fact
Don't know why I left, I'm coming back
Coming on back to you


Got a feeling inside (Can't explain)
It's a certain kind (Can't explain)
I feel hot and cold (Can't explain)
Yeah, down in my soul, yeah (Can't explain)

I said (Can't explain)
I'm feeling good now, yeah, but (Can't explain)

Dizzy in the head and I'm feeling blue
The things you've said, well, maybe they're true
I'm gettin' funny dreams again and again
I know what it means, but

Can't explain
I think it's love
Try to say it to you
When I feel blue

But I can't explain (Can't explain)
Yeah, hear what I'm saying, girl (Can't explain)

Dizzy in the head and I'm feeling bad
The things you've said have got me real mad
I'm gettin' funny dreams again and again
I know what it means but

Can't explain
I think it's love
Try to say it to you
When I feel blue

But I can't explain (Can't explain)
Forgive me one more time, now (Can't explain)

I said I can't explain, yeah
You drive me out of my mind
Yeah, I'm the worrying kind, babe
I said I can't explain


Run, run, run
Run, run, run
Run, run, run
Run, run, run

Well baby, better take my advice
A black cat crossed your path twice
The moon came out next to the 1
Then you opened your umbrella in a room

[chorus:]
You better run, run, run
Run, run, run
Run, run, run
Run, run, run

Well you ain't the luckiest girl I know
And you won't get luckier the way you're going
Your horseshoe's rusty and your mirror's cracked
You walk under ladders then you walk right back

[chorus]

When you dropped that little pin
Never thought what a mess it'd get you in
Little pin, little pin, bring me luck
Because I stopped to pick you up

[chorus]

Well now, little girl, I'm helping you
I hope you believe what I say is true
Whenever you run, I'll be running too
Whenever you run, I'll be following you

[chorus]

Run, run, run


Look, he's crawling up my wall
Black and hairy, very small
Now he's up above my head
Hanging by a little thread

Boris the spider
Boris the spider

Now he's dropped on to the floor
Heading for the bedroom door
Maybe he's as scared as me
Where's he gone now, I can't see

Boris the spider
Boris the spider

Creepy, crawly
Creepy, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly

There he is wrapped in a ball
Doesn't seem to move at all
Perhaps he's dead, I'll just make sure
Pick this book up off the floor

Boris the spider
Boris the spider

Creepy, crawly
Creepy, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly

He's come to a sticky end
Don't think he will ever mend
Never more will he crawl 'round
He's embedded in the ground

Boris the spider
Boris the spider


Knowing
Is what people tell you
That you're thinking wrong
Embrace you,
But they really mean "So long"

You talk to them
They laugh aloud
Yet they run to you
In any crowd

Please talk to me again
I need you

We're dancing
We will come and dance near you
We want to learn
Let us come and sitar with you

Distort my ears when
The music's loud
Yet you raise your hatchet
In the yellow crowd

Please talk to me again
I need you

Knowing
Is what people tell you
That you're thinking wrong
Embrace you,
But they really mean "So long"

You talk to them
They laugh aloud
Yet they run to you
In any crowd

Please talk to me again
I need you


Whiskey Man's my friend, he's with me nearly all the time
He always joins me when I drink, and we get on just fine

Nobody has ever seen him, I'm the only one
Seemingly I must be mad, Insanity is fun
If that's the way it's done

Doctors say he just a figment of my twisted mind
If they can't see my Whiskey Man they must be going blind

Two men dressed in white collected me two days ago
They said there's only room for one and Whiskey Man can't go

Whiskey Man will waste away if he's left on his own
I can't even ring him 'cause he isn't on the phone
Hasn't got a home

Life is very gloomy in my little padded cell
It's a shame there wasn't room for Whiskey Man as well

Whiskey Man's my friend, he's with me nearly all the time
He always joins me when I drink, and we get on just fine
Just fine


Heat wave
Heat wave

Whenever I'm with you
Something inside
Starts to burn deep
And my heart's filled with fire
Could be that I'm very sentimental
Or is this just the way love's supposed to be?

[chorus:]
I got a heat wave
Burning in my heart
I can't keep from crying
Tearing me apart

Sometimes she calls my name
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can't explain
I feel, yeah I feel
I feel this burning flame
This high blood pressure's got a hold on me
'Cause this is the way love's supposed to be

[chorus]

Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Just give me another chance
This could be a new romance

Heat wave
Heat wave
Heat wave
Heat wave


Don't go and hide
Yesterday you were my girlfiend
If you do
My inside goes around and around in a whirlwind

There's a stone in my shoe
So I can't catch you up
My head's in a lion's mouth
Wants to eat me up
Right here today
Don't look away
I've always been true
And I still love you
So don't look away
There's a lot you can do
To get me away
You've got to stay
Don't look away
Don't look away

I once heard you say
If I ever was down you would help me
Now my head's being chewed up
You pretend that you don't see

There's a stone in my shoe
So I can't catch you up
My head's in a lion's mouth
Wants to eat me up
Right here today
Don't look away
I've always been true
And I still love you
So don't look away
There's a lot you can do
To get me away
You've got to stay
Don't look away
Don't look away

I've always been true
And I still love you
So don't look away
There's a lot you can do
To get me away
You've got to stay
Don't look away
Don't look away
Don't look away
Don't look away
Don't look away


Some way, some day, I'll find a way
To make you see my way

Even if you don't think like I do
You know that it's true
It's your mind that I seek

Tried so hard to make me think my point of view was bad
Although at times when you kept on I thought that I was mad

I'm glad it's goodbye
You don't have to ask why
Come back another day
Come back when you see my way
You see my way

Tried so hard to make me think my point of view was bad
Although at times when you kept on I thought that I was mad

Some way, some day, I'll find a way
To make you see my way

I'm glad it's goodbye
You don't have to ask why
Come back another day
Come back when you see my way
You see my way
You see my way

So sad about us
So sad about us
Sad that the news is out now
Sad, suppose we can't turn back now
Sad about us

So bad about us
So bad about us
Bad - never meant to break up
Bad - suppose we'll never make up
Bad about us

Apologies mean nothing
When the damage is done
But I can't switch off my loving
Like you can't switch off the sun

My name is Ivor

So let's have a smile for an old engine driver

Do my eyes deceive me?
Am I back in your arms?
Away from all harm?

It's like a dream to be with you again
Can't believe that I'm with you again

I missed you and I must admit
I kissed a few and once did sit
On Ivor the Engine Driver's lap
And later with him, had a nap

You are forgiven, you are forgiven, you are forgiven ... [ad lib]

You are forgiven


Happy Jack wasn't old, but he was a man
He lived in the sand at the Isle of Man
The kids would all sing, he would take the wrong key
So they rode on his head in their furry donkey

The kids couldn't hurt Jack
They tried, tried, tried
They dropped things on his back
They lied, lied, lied, lied, lied

But they couldn't stop Jack, or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happy

But they couldn't stop Jack, or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happy

The kids couldn't hurt Jack
They tried, tried, tried
They dropped things on his back
They lied, lied, lied, lied, lied

But they couldn't stop Jack, or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happy

I saw yer!

I paid five bucks for my Bucket T
Took me three years of sweat and blood
To clean off all that Tennessee mud

Cruise down the street in front of school
I wanna rev it up but I gotta be cool
Drivin' down the road I'll get my kicks
A'poppin' the clutch and a'slippin' the sticks

I was right, too, she's first in her class
There's nothing on the freeway she don't pass
All the girls want to take a ride with me
But there's only one seat in my Bucket T

Ba ba ba, ba Barbara Ann,
Ba ba ba, ba Barbara Ann,
Barbara Ann, take my hand, Barbara Ann
You've got me rockin' and a'rollin'
Rockin' and a'reelin' Barbara Ann

I went to a dance
Looking for romance
Saw Barbara Ann so I thought I'd take a chance
With Barbara Ann, Barbara Ann
You've got me rockin' and a'rollin'
Rockin' and a'reelin' Barbara Ann

Tried Mary Lou, 
Tried Peggy Sue,
Tried Freddie too
But I knew she wouldn't do
Like Barbara Ann, Barbara Ann
You've got me rockin' and a'rollin'
Rockin' and a'reelin' Barbara Ann

I used to know everything about you
But today when I tried to point you out to one of my friends
I picked the wrong girl again
Don't see you in the crowd anymore
I think it's you but I can't be sure
You're wearing disguises
Occasionally a girl surprises me
When she turns out to be you
Wearing disguises 

I don't think you want me to see you ever again
And today I saw you dressed as a flower bed
Last week you had a wig on your head
Directing traffic in the street
And your shoes were too big for your feet
You were wearing disguises
Occasionally a girl surprises me
When she turns out to be you
Wearing disguises

[repeat first verse]
Wearing disguises
Wearing disguises
Wearing disguises
Wearing disguises


Doctor, there's something wrong with me
My health is not all that it used to be
My heart is out of beat, I got chokers on my feet
My eyesight's getting dimmer, I can't see

Doctor thanks for seeing me today, I'm glad,
I've got every sickness there is to be had
I had whooping cough last month
And today I've got the mumps
And tomorrow I'll catch chicken pox as well.

Doctor doctor doctor make me well
I've not got long to go now I can tell
Doctor doctor doctor make me well
I've not got long to go I can tell
I've not got long to go I can tell

Those pills I took have no effect at all
Just the other day I had a nasty fall
And I think I broke my jaw when it hit the kitchen floor
And I'm shrinking last week I was five foot four

I've been getting shivers lately, is it flu?
I know the bug is going round, what can I do?
It's about to pick on me, I've still got the other three
Do you think I caught smallpox I'd get flu?

[chorus]

Do you think it's time that I made out my will?
I'll leave everything to you to pay my bill
Just how long is there to go
Please tell me I want to know
But on second thoughts don't tell me, I'm too ill.


I've been away so long
Wonder where I went wrong
Spent my last years in a cell
Never ever go away again
I've been so sad and lonely
Never ever ever gonna go away again

It's a waste of time doing time
When you dind't commit a crime
It wasn't me it was my brother Bill
And I'd have to tell never gonna speak to Bill again
He's made me sad and lonely
Never ever gonna speak to brother Bill again

It was no use, they put my brother on the jury
He bribed the others 'cause he owns the local brewery
They let me out today
Brother Bill's gonna pay
No one's ever gonna speak to Bill again
Never ever gonna speak to Bill again
He'll be too cold and bony
Never ever gonna go away again
Never ever gonna go away again
Never ever gonna go away again


Come along
Into the city
Where the girls are pretty
And you can't go wrong 

Take your time
No need to hurry
Don't have to worry
Cause it won't take long

Well you can surf in the city
You can swim in the pools
Do anything you want
Because there ain't no rules
Drive your super-stock carbur to the long highway
And you can drag.

In the city in the falling right
The kids are hip and they can dance all night
In the city all the girls are pretty and they go...

In the city, into the city...


She wants a man with lots of money
Not a poor boy
He buys her things she calls him honey
She calls me poor boy
What good could it do
To give a love pure and true
When any fool could understand
She thinks that money makes the man

She wants a man with lots of money
Not a poor boy
She wants the things she'll buy with money
Not a poor boy
A man with money,man with money, man with money

Just down the street
I know a place
When they're asleep
I'll cover my face
I'll break the lock, open the door
I'll slip inside, I'll rob the store

Then I'll be a man with lots of money
Not a poor boy
I'll buy her things, she'll call me honey
Not a poor boy
A man with money, man with money, man with money, man with money


People try to put us d-down (Talkin' 'bout my generation)

If you're troubled and you can't relax
Close your eyes and think of this
If the rumors floating in your head all turn to facts
Close your eyes and think of this

Armenia, city in the sky
Armenia, city in the sky

If you ever want to lose some time
Just take off, there's no risk
If you ever want to disappear
Just take off, and think of this

Armenia, city in the sky
Armenia, city in the sky

The sky is glass, the sea is brown
And everyone is upside-down

Armenia, city in the sky
Armenia, city in the sky

Freak out!
Freak out!

One, two, three, four!

What's for tea, Mum?
What's for tea, darling?
Darling, I said "what's for tea?"
What's for tea, daughter?

I danced with Linda
I danced with Jean
I danced with Cindy
Then I suddenly see

Mary-Anne with the shaky hands
What they've done to her man
Those shaky hands

Mary is so pretty
The prettiest in the land
Guys come from every city
Just to shake her shaky hands

Linda can cook
Jean reads books
Cindy can sew
But I'd rather know

Mary-Anne with the shaky hands
What they've done to her man
Those shaky hands

Mary-Anne with the shaky hands
What they've done to her man
Those shaky hands

Mary-Anne with the shaky hands
What they've done to her man
Those shaky hands


She sang the best she'd ever sang
She couldn't ever sing any better
But Mister Davidson never rang
She knew he would forget her

She'd seen him there
And put herself to ransom
He had stared
He really was quite handsome

She had really looked her best
She couldn't ever look any better
But she knew she'd failed the test
She knew he would forget her

Triumphant was the way she felt
As she acknowledged the applause
Triumphant was the way she'd felt
When she saw him at the dressing room door

She was happier than she'd ever been
As he praised her for her grace
But his expression changed, she had seen
As he leant to kiss her face

It ended there
He claimed a late appoinment
She quickly turned
To hide her disappointment

She ripped her glittering gown
Couldn't face another show, no
Her deodorant had let her down
She should have used Odorono


Me and my brother were talking to each other
'Bout what makes a man a man
Was it brain or brawn, or the month you were born
We just couldn't understand

Our old man didn't like our appearance
He said that only women wear long hair

So me and my brother borrowed money from Mother
We knew what we had to do
We went downstairs, past the barber and gymnasium
And got our arms tattooed

Welcome to my life, tattoo
I'm a man now, thanks to you
I expect I'll regret you
But the skin graft man won't get you
You'l be there when I die
Tattoo

My dad beat me 'cause mine said "Mother"
But my mother naturally liked it and beat my brother
'Cause his tattoo was of a lady in the nude
And my mother thought that was extremely rude

Welcome to my life, tattoo
We've a long time together, me and you
I expect I'll regret you
But the skin graft man won't get you
You'll be there when I die
Tattoo

Now I'm older, I'm tattooed all over
My wife is tattooed too
A rooty-toot-toot, rooty-tooty-toot-toot
Rooty-toot-toot tattoo too
To you


Our love was ...

Our love was famine, frustration
We only acted out an imitation
Of what real love should have been
Then suddenly ...

Our love was flying
Our love was soaring
Our love was shining
Like a summer morning

Flying, soaring
Shining morning
Never leaving
Lying, dying

Love love love long
Love love love long
Love love love long
Love love love long

Love love love long
Love love love long
Love love love long
Love love love long

Love love love long
Love love love long
Love love love long
Love love love long

Our love was flying
Our love was soaring
Our love was shining
Like a summer morning

Our love was famine, frustration
We only acted out an imitation
Of what real love should have been
And then suddenly ...

Our love was flying
Our love was soaring
Our love was shining
Like a summer morning


I know you've deceived me, now here's a surprise
I know that you have 'cause there's magic in my eyes

I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah

If you think that I don't know about the little tricks you've played
And never see you when deliberately you put things in my way

Well, here's a poke at you
You're gonna choke on it too
You're gonna lose that smile
Because all the while

I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah

You took advantage of my trust in you when I was so far away
I saw you holding lots of other guys and now you've got the nerve to say

That you still want me
Well, that's as may be
But you gotta stand trial
Because all the while

I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah

I know you've deceived me, now here's a surprise
I know that you have 'cause there's magic in my eyes

I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah

The Eiffel Tower and the Taj Mahal are mine to see on clear days
You thought that I would need a crystal ball to see right through the haze

Well, here's a poke at you
You're gonna choke on it too
You're gonna lose that smile
Because all the while

I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
and miles and miles and miles and miles

I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles


I'm a million ages past you
A million years behind you too
A thousand miles up in the air
A trillion times I've seen you there

Your hair is golden, mine is grey
You walk on grass, it turns to hay
You blood is blue and mine is red
My body strains, but the nerves are dead

I can't reach you
I've strained my eyes
I can't reach you
I've split my sides
I can't reach
Tryin' to get on you
See, feel or hear from you

The distances grow greater now
You drink champagne and past me plow
You fly your plane right over my head
You're still alive and I'm nearly dead

I can't reach you
With arms outstretched
I can't reach you
I crane my neck
I can't reach
Tryin' to get on you
See, feel or hear from you

Once I caught a glimpse
Of your unguarded, untouched heart
Our fingertips touched and then
My mind tore us apart

I can't reach you
With arms outstretched
I can't reach you
I crane my neck
I can't reach
Tryin' to get on you
See, feel or hear from you

I can't reach you
With arms outstretched
I can't reach you
I crane my neck
I can't reach
Tryin' to get on you
See, feel or hear from you


Henry Pond had no fun
Had a face like a currant bun
This adolescent little fella
Was nicknamed by his friends "Old Yella"

The doctors gave him creams and lotions
To try to sooth the boys emotions
But all in vain; the acne stayed
Henry's hopes began to fade

Then, when just about to crack
He found another cream - Medac

When Henry in the mirror peered
His pimples all had disappeared
Henry laughed and yelled "I got 'em!
Me face is like a baby's bottom"


Relax and settle down
Let your mind go 'round
Lay down on the ground
And listen to the sound
Of the band
Hold my hand

Open up your mind
We'll love right where we lie
I'll know you from inside
You're like a horse I'll ride
O'er the sand
Through the land

Relax and let your mind roll on
Over all your problems
Relax and let your mind roll on
Over all your problems

We try harder and harder, tryin' to get our way
But it's a long, long wait until Judgement Day
So settle your affairs and take your time
'Cause everything in the world is yours and mine
Yours and mine

Relax and settle down
Let your mind go 'round
Lay down on the ground
And listen to the sound
Of the band
Hold my hand

Relax!


Once upon a time there lived an old miser man
By the name of Silas Stingy
He carried all his money in a little black box
Which was heavy as a rock
With a big padlock
All the little kids would shout
When Silas was about

[Chorus:]
Money, money, money bags
Money, money, money bags
There goes mingy Stingy
There goes mingy Stingy
Money, money, money bags
Money, money, money bags
There goes mingy Stingy
There goes mingy Stingy

Silas didn't eat, which was just as well
He would starve himself for a penny
He wore old clothes and he never washed
'Cause soap cost a lot
And the dirt kept him hot
All the little kids would shout
When Silas was about

[chorus]

In the back of his head
Was a voice that said
"Someone will steal it all
You'll be lying in the gutter with an empty box
The thieves will be having a ball"

[chorus]

He bought a safe to put the box in
And a house to put the safe in
And a watchdog on a chain to make quite sure
And his face was very funny
When he counted up his money
And he realized he hadn't any more

[chorus]


You take away the breath I was keeping for sunrise
You appear and the morning looks drab in my eyes
And then again I'll turn down love
Having seen you again
Once more you'll disappear
My morning put to shame

You take away the breath I was keeping for sunrise
You appear and the morning looks drab in my eyes
And then again I'll turn down love
Having seen you again
Once more you'll disappear
My morning put to shame

Sometimes I fear that this will go on my life through
Each day I spend in an echoed vision of you
And then again I'll turn down love
Remembering your smile
My every day is spent
Thinking of you all the while

The times I've let myself down
My head's spinning 'round
My eyes see only you
The chances I've lost
Opportunities tossed
Away and into the blue

You take away the breath I was keeping for sunrise
You appear and the morning looks drab in my eyes
And then again I'll turn down love
Having seen you again
Then again you'll disappear
My morning put to shame


The Red Chins in their millions
Will overspill their borders
And chaos then will reign in our Rael

Rael, the home of my religion
To me the center of the Earth

The Red Chins in their millions
Will overspill their borders
And chaos then will reign in our Rael

My heritage is threatened
My roots are torn and cornered
And so to do my best I'll homeward sail
And so to do my best I'll homeward sail

Now Captain, listen to my instructions
Return to this spot on Christmas Day
Look toward the shore for my signal
And then you'll know if in Rael I'll stay

If a yellow flag is fluttering
Sickly herald against the morn
Then you'll know my courage has ended
And you'll send your boat ashore

But if a red flag is flying
Brazen bold against the blue
Then you'll know that I am staying
And my yacht belongs to you

Now Captain, listen to my instructions
Return to this spot on Christmas Day
Look toward the shore for my signal
And then you'll know if in Rael I'll stay

He's crazy if he thinks we're coming back again
He's crazy if he thinks we're coming back again
He's crazy if he thinks we're coming back again
He's crazy, anyway

If a yellow flag is fluttering
Sickly herald against the morn
Then you'll know my courage has ended
And you'll send your boat ashore


What I see is all I've seen
In my sweetest sleep in dreams
What I feel is all I've felt
When by newborn babes I've knelt
What I know now is all I've known
That has been good while I have grown
Bless the thoughts that made me sail
And the God who made Rael


She wasn't a fool
That glittering girl
She followed the rules
That shimmering pearl

Said the rules mama preaches
Go down when they break
The themes mama teaches
You just gotta shake

But she wasn't a fool
That slender love figure
She followed her rules
And made money bigger

She wasn't a fool
That shining young woman
She followed her rules
She's crying for no man

Said the rules mama preaches
Go down when they're broken
She explodes into peaches
And cries when I've spoken

She wasn't a fool
That Goddess of Hell
There are no mother's rules
She makes them herself

And I was down upon my knees
To beg her surrender up to me

Something inside her
Told her she shouldn't
Tried and alight her
But the girl wouldn't

She wasn't a fool
But love flowed from her face
She's not scared of me
She's afraid of disgrace

She wasn't a fool
That female for our world
She followed her rules
That glittering girl
That glittering girl
That glittering girl
That glittering girl


My coffee's cold, my paper's old,
My heart is sold to melancholia,
My clothes are torn, my shoes are worn,
My heart is born to melancholia.

A strange surprise, what I despise in other guys is here in me,
They lose their girl, they lose their world,
And then they cry for all to see,
I've never felt so bad, the fires drive me mad.

The sheets are gray, left since the day she went away, I lost all power,
The dust is thick, the dog is sick, the kids have picked most of the flowers.

The sun is shining, but not for me,
The sun is shining, but not for me.
I've never felt so bad, the fires drive me mad.

The sheets are gray, left since the day she went away, I lost all power,
The dog is sick, the dust is thick, the kids have picked most of the flowers.


Goodnight baby,
Someone's a-comin', someone's a-comin',
Goodnight baby,
Gotta get a-runnin', gotta get a-runnin'.

Your father doesn't like me,
Told you that you couldn't see me any more,
That's why we meet in secret,
That's why we're hiding here.

Goodnight baby,
Same time tomorrow, same time tomorrow,
Goodnight baby,
See you here tomorrow, see you here tomorrow.

Your mother made you stay in,
When she saw you going out with me,
You'll say you'll take the dog out,
Then you sneak out here to me.

If your parents find you here,
You're gonna get a hiding, gonna get a hiding,
So I'll vanish, disappear,
See you here tomorrow, see you here tomorrow.


Grace space race.

Everything they've seen you have seen,
Everywhere they've been you have been,
Everything they've done you have been and done already.

Every lovely spot near or far,
You can reach them too in your car,
Or you might be there now if you own a jag already.

The radio blasting, the girls are glancing,
The dash is dancing with gleaming dials

Grace space race.
Grace space race.
Jaguar, jaguar, jaguar, jaguar.


3:36, it's cold, I know I'm growing old,
With life's best side on the downward slope,
It's in my own hands, I know I'll cope,
My girl's with me and all my friends can see.

Here I am again,
Early morning cold taxi.
Early morning cold taxi.

Done it before, do it again,
Know from experience it's not in vain,
She's the best I've had, I cannot see, what someone else can do to me.
It's a long way home but love's so warm, you'll see.

Here I am again,
Early morning cold taxi.
Early morning cold taxi.

Early morning cold taxi,
Each time I do it, I feel so down and out,
Early morning cold taxi,
'though my mind thinks strange I'll keep on, no doubt.

3:36, it's cold, I know I'm growing old,
One day we'll be wed,
This I know for it's what she said,
Then no more will my mind be uneasy.

Girl's eyes, butterflies, how she cries, can't get through to you,
She knows all the charts, breaks her heart, thinks a lot of you,
Each time you play a melody, it means the earth to this little girl,
Can you be cruel and break her heart, tear her small world apart.

She's there, eyes aglow, very front row, don't throw sticks at her,
Please don't look her way, see her way, don't care anyway.

It's you who led her on, I see,
Just leave her down in her misery,
She don't want help from you and me,
Can't tell a note from a symphony.

It's you who led her on, I see,
Just leave her down in her misery,

Separates and lingerie, seven pairs of shoes,
Lots of Woolworth's makeup, a pair of Black Watch trews,
Your out-of-tune piano, sentimental photographs,
A million little memories, a million little laughs.

The wing of the airplane has just caught on fire,
I say without reservation we ain't getting no higher.

All you wanted from me, all I had to give,
Nothing matters you'll see, when in paradise you live,
The plane is diving faster, we're getting near the ground,
Nobody is screaming, no one makes a sound.

It's a girl, Mrs. Walker, it's a girl,
It's a girl, Mrs. Walker, it's a girl,
It's a girl, Mrs. Walker, it's a girl,
It's a girl, Mrs. Walker, it's a girl.


Captain Walker didn't come home
His unborn child will never know him
Believe him missing with a number of men
Don't expect to see him again


It's a boy, Mrs. Walker, it's a boy!
It's a boy, Mrs. Walker, it's a boy!

A son!
A son!
A son!


[Lover:]

I've got a feeling twenty one
Is going to be a good year.
Especially if you and me
See it in together.

[Father:]

So you think 21 is going to be a good year.
It could be for me and her,
But you and her-no never!
I had no reason to be over optimistic,
But somehow when you smiled
I could brave bad weather

[Mother:]

What about the boy?
What about the boy?
What about the boy?
He saw it all!

[Mother and Father:]

You didn't hear it
You didn't see it.
You won't say nothing to no one
ever in your life.
You never heard it
Oh how absurd it
All seems without any proof.
You didn't hear it
You didn't see it
You never heard it not a word of it.
You won't say nothing to no one
Never tell a soul
What you know is the Truth.


Deaf, dumb and blind boy
He's in a quiet vibration land
Strange as it seems
His musical dreams
Ain't quite so bad

Ten years old
With thoughts as bold
As thought can be
Loving life and becoming wise
In simplicity

Sickness can surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know

A vague haze of delirium
Creeps up on me
All at once a tall stranger
I suddenly see
He's dressed in a silver-sparked
Glittering gown
And his golden beard flows
Nearly down to the ground

Nothing to say, and nothing to hear
And nothing to see
Each sensation makes a note
In my symphony

Sickness can surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know

His eyes are the eyes 
That transmit all they know
Sparkle warm crystalline glances to show
That he is your leader
And he is your guide
On the amazing journey together you'll ride


[The Hawker:]

You talk about your woman
I wish you could see mine,
You talk about your woman
I wish you could see mine,
Every time she starts to lovin'
She brings eyesight to the blind.

You know her daddy gave her magic
I can tell by the way she walks.
You know her daddy gave her magic
I can tell by the way she walks.
Everytime we start shakin'
The dumb begin to talk.

She's got the power to heal you never fear
She's got the power to heal you never fear
Just a word from her lips
And the deaf begin to hear.


[Father:]

Did you ever see the faces of children
They get so excited.
Waking up on christmas morning
Hours before the winter sun's ignited.
They believe in dreams and all they mean
Including heavens generosity.
Peeping round the door
to see what parcels are for free
In curiosity.

And Tommy doesn't know what day it is.
Doesn't know who Jesus was or what praying is.
How can he be saved?
From the eternal grave.

Surrounded by his friends he sits so silently,
And unaware of everything.
Playing poxy pin ball
picks his nose and smiles and
Pokes his tongue at everything.
I believe in love
but how can men who've never seen
Light be enlightened.
Only if he's cured
will his spirits future level ever heighten.

And Tommy doesn't know what day it is.
Doesn't know who Jesus was or what praying is.
How can he be saved?
>From the eternal grave.
Tommy can you hear me?
Tommy can you hear me?
Tommy can you hear me?
How can he be saved?

[Tommy:]

See me, feel me
Touch me, heal me.
See me, feel me
Touch me, heal me!

Tommy can you hear me?
Tommy can you hear me?
Tommy can you hear me?
How can he be saved?


[Cousin Kevin:]

Were on our own cousin,
all alone cousin.
Let's think of a game to play
Now the grownups have all gone away.
You won't be much fun
being blind deaf and dumb
But I've no one to play with today.
D'you know how to play hide and seek?
To find me it would take you a week,
But tied to that chair you won't go anywhere
There's a lot I can do to a freak.
How would you feel if I turned on the bath,
Ducked your head under and started to laugh.
What would you do if I shut you outside,
To stand in the rain
and catch cold so you died?

I'm the school bully !
The classroom cheat.
The nastiest playfriend,
You ever could meet.
I'll stick pins in your fingers
And tread on your feet...

Maybe a cigarette burn on your arm
Would change your expression to one of alarm,
I'll drag you around by a lock of your hair
Or give you a push at the top of the stairs...

I'm the school bully !
The classroom cheat.
The nastiest playfriend,
You ever could meet.
I'll put glass in your dinner
And spikes in your seat...


[Gypsy:]

If your child ain't all he should be now
This girl will put him right.
I'll show him what he could be now
Just give me one night.
I'm the Gypsy - the acid Queen.
Pay before we start.
I'm the Gypsy - The acid queen.
I'll tear your soul apart.

Give us a room and close the door
Leave us for a while.
Your boy won't be a boy no more
Young, but not a child.
I'm the Gypsy - the acid queen.
Pay before we start.
I'm the Gypsy the acid queen.
I'll tear your soul apart.

Gather your wits and hold on fast,
Your mind must learn to roam.
Just as the Gypsy Queen must do
You're gonna hit the road.

My work is done now look at him
He's never been more alive.
His head it shakes his fingers clutch.
Watch his body writhe
I'm the Gypsy - the acid queen.
Pay before we start.
I'm the Gypsy - I'm guaranteed.
To break your little heart.


Do you think it's alright
To leave the boy with Uncle Ernie?
Do you think it's alright
He's had a few too many tonight
Do you think it's alright? I think it's alright

I'm your wicked Uncle Ernie
I'm glad you won't see or hear me
As I fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about

Your mother left me here to mind you
Now I'm doing what I want to
Fiddling about, fiddling about, fiddle about

Down with the bedclothes
Up with your nightshirt
Fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about

Fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about

You won't shout as I fiddle about
Fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about
Fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about

Fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about
Fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about

Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle


[Uncle Ernie:]

I'm your wicked Uncle Ernie
I'm glad you won't see or hear me
As I fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about !

Your mother left me here to mind you
Now I'm doing what I want to
Fiddling about
Fiddling about
Fiddle about!

Down with the bedclothes
Up with the nightshirt!
Fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about !

You won't shout as I fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about !
Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle.


Ever since I was a young boy
I've played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all
But I ain't seen nothing like him
In any amusement hall

That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball!

He stands like a statue
Becomes part of the machine
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean
Plays by intuition
The digit counters fall

That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball!

He's a pinball wizard
There has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist

'How do you think he does it?
I don't know
What makes him so good?'

Ain't got no distractions
Can't hear no buzzers and bells
Don't see no lights a-flashin'
Plays by sense of smell
Always gets the replay
Never seen him fall

That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball!

I thought I was The Bally table king
But I just handed my pinball crown to him

Even on my favorite table
He can beat my best
His disciples lead him in
And he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers
Never seen him fall

That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball!


[Father:]

There's a man I've found
Could bring us all joy!
There's a doctor I've found could cure the boy!
There's a doctor I've found could cure the boy!

There's a man I've found could remove his sorrow,
He lives in this town let's see him tomorrow,
He lives in this town let's see him tomorrow!


[Doctor:]
He seems to be completely unreceptive
The tests I gave him show no sense at all
His eyes react to light the dials detect it
He hears but cannot answer to your call

[Tommy:]
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me

[Doctor:]
There is no chance no untried operation
All hope lies with him and none with me
Imagine though the shock from isolation
When he suddenly can hear and speak and see

[Tommy:]
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me

[Doctor:]
His eyes can see
His ears can hear his lips speak
All the time the needles flick and rock
No machine can give the kind of stimulation
Needed to remove his inner block

Go to the mirror boy
Go to the mirror boy

[Father:]
I often wonder what he's feeling
Has he ever heard a word I've said?
Look at him in the mirror dreaming
What is happening in his head?

[Tommy:]
Listening to you I get the music
Gazing at you I get the heat
Following you I climb the mountain
I get excitement at your feet

Right behind you I see the millions
On you I see the glory
From you I get opinions
From you I get the story

[Father:]
What is happening in his head
Ooooh I wish I knew, I wish I knew


Tommy can you hear me?
Can you feel me near you?

[Mother:]

Tommy can you feel me?
Can I help to cheer you.


[Mother:]

You don't answer my call
With even a nod or a twitch
But you gaze at your own reflection!
You don't seem to see me
But I think you can see yourself.
How can the mirror affect you?

Can you hear me
Or do I surmise?
That you fear me can you feel my temper
RISE.

Do you hear or fear or
Do I smash the mirror.
Do you hear of fear or
Do I smash the mirror? SMASH!


[Tommy:]

I overwhelm as I approach you
Make your lungs hold breath inside!
Lovers break caresses for me
Love enhanced when I've gone by.

You'll feel me coming,
A new vibration
From afar you'll see me
I'm a sensation.

They worship me and all I touch
Hazy eyed they catch my glance,
Pleasant shudders shake their senses
My warm momentum throws their stance.

You'll feel me coming
A new vibration
From afar you'll see me
I'm a sensation.

I leave a trail of rooted people
Mesmerised by just the sight,
The few I touch are now disciples
Love as One I Am the Light...

Soon you'll see me can't you feel me
I'm coming...
Send your troubles dancing he knows the answer
I'm coming...
I'm a sensation.


[Newsboy:]

Extra! Extra!
Read all about it.
Pin Ball Wizard in a miracle cure!
Extra Extra read all about it
EXTRA!


Outside the house Mr. Simpson announced
that Sally couldn't go to the meeting.
He went on cleaning his blue Rolls Royce
and she ran inside weeping.
She got to her room and tears splashed the picture
of the new Messiah.
She picked up a book of her fathers life
and threw it on the fire!

She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart,
But her Mother said never mind your part...
Is to be what you'll be.

The theme of the sermon was come unto me,
Love will find a way,
So Sally decided to ignore her dad,
and sneak out anyway!
She spent all afternoon getting ready,
and decided she'd try to touch him,
Maybe he'd see that she was free
and talk to her this Sunday.

She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart,
But her Mother said never mind your part...
Is to be what you'll be.

She arrived at six and the place was swinging
to gospel music by nine.
Group after group appeared on the stage
and Sally just sat there crying.
She bit her nails looking pretty as a picture
right in the very front row
And then a DJ wearing a blazer with a badge
ran on and said 'here we go!'

The crowd went crazy
As Tommy hit the stage!
Little Sally got lost as the police bossed
The crowd back in a rage!

But soon the atmosphere was cooler
as Tommy gave a lesson.
Sally just had to let him know she loved him
and leapt up on the rostrum!
She ran cross stage to the spotlit figure
and touched him on the face
Tommy whirled around as a uniformed man,
threw her of the stage.

She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart,
But her Mother said never mind your part...
Is to be what you'll be.
Her cheek hit a chair and blood trickled down,
mingling with her tears,
Tommy carried on preaching
and his voice filled Sally's ear
She caught his eye she had to try
but couldn't see through the lights
Her face was gashed and the ambulance men
had to carry her out that night.

The crowd went crazy
As Tommy left the stage!
Little Sally was lost for the price of a touch
And a gash across her face! OOoooh.

Sixteen stitches put her right and her Dad said
'don't say I didn't warn yer'.
Sally got married to a rock musician
she met in California
Tommy always talks about the day
the disciples all went wild!
Sally still carries a scar on her cheek
to remind her of his smile.

She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart,
But her Mother said never mind your part...
Is to be what you'll be.


[Tommy:]

I'M FREE- I'm free,
And freedom tastes of reality,
I'm free-I'm free,
AN' I'm waiting for you to follow me.

If I told you what it takes
to reach the highest high,
You'd laugh and say 'nothing's that simple'
But you've been told many times before
Messiahs pointed to the door
And no one had the guts to leave the temple!

I'm free-I'm free
And freedom tastes of reality
I'm free-I'm free
And I'm waiting for you to follow me.

[Chorus:]

How can we follow?
How can we follow?


[Tommy:]

Come to my house
Be one of the comfortable people.
Come to this house
We're drinking all night
Never sleeping.

Milkman come in!
And you baker,
Little old lady welcome
And you shoe maker

Come to this house!
Into this house.

Come to this house
Be one of us.
Make this your house
Be one of us.

You can help
To collect some more in
Young and old people
Lets get them all in!

Come to this house!
Into this house.

Ask along that man who's wearing a carnation.
Bring every single person
from Victoria Station,
Go into that hospital
and bring nurses and patients,
Everybody go home and fetch their relations!

Come to this house
Be one of the comfortable people.
Lovely bright home
Drinking all night never sleeping.

We need more room
Build an extension
A colourful palace
Spare no expense now

Come to this house
Be one of us
Come into this house
Be one of us

Come to this house
Into this house

Welcome


[Uncle Ernie:]
Good morning Campers!

I'm your Uncle Ernie
and I'll welcome you to Tommy's Holiday Camp
The camp with the difference
Nevermind the weather
When you come to Tommy's
The holiday's forever


Welcome to the camp
I guess you all know why we're here
My name is Tommy
And I became aware this year
If you want to follow me
You've got to play pinball
And put in your ear plugs
Put on your eye shades
You know where to put the cork

Hey you gettin' drunk
So sorry, I got you sussed
Hey you smokin' mother nature
This is a bust
Hey hung up old Mr. Normal
Don't try to gain my trust
'Cause you ain't gonna follow me
Any of those ways
Although you think you must

We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
Never did and never will
We're not gonna take it
Gonna break it
Gonna shake it
Let's forget it better still

Now you can't hear me
Your ears are truly sealed
You can't speak either
Your mouth is filled
You can't see nothing
And pinball completes the scene
Here comes Uncle Ernie
To guide you to
Your very own machine

We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
Never did and never will
Don't want no religion
And as far as we can tell
We ain't gonna take you
Never did and never will
We forsake you
Gonna rape you
Let's forget you better still

We forsake you
Gonna rape you
Let's forget you better still

See me, feel me
Touch me, heal me
See me, feel me
Touch me, heal me
See me, feel me
Touch me, heal me
See me, feel me
Touch me, heal me

Listening to you, I get the music
Gazing at you, I get the heat
Following you, I climb the mountain
I get excitement at your feet
Right behind you, I see the millions
On you, I see the glory
From you, I get opinions
From you, I get the story

[repeat until fade]
