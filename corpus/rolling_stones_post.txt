Why don't we sing this song all together
Open our heads let the pictures come
And if we close all our eyes together
Then we will see where we all come from

Pictures of us through the steamy haze
Pictures of us painted in our place

Why don't we sing this song all together
Open our heads let the pictures come
And if we close all our eyes together
Then we will see where we all come from

Why don't we sing this song all together
Open our heads let the pictures come
And if we close all our eyes together
Then we will see where we all come from

Pictures of us beating on our drum
Never stopping 'til the rain has come

Why don't we sing this song all together
Open our heads let the pictures come
And if we close all our eyes together
Then we will see where we all come from

Men are armed shout who goes there
We have journeyed far from here
Armed with bibles make us swear

Candy and Taffy, hope you both are well
Please come see me in the citadel

Flags are flying, dollar bills
Round the heights of concrete hills
You can see the pinnacles

Candy and Taffy, hope you both are well
Please come see me in the citadel

In the streets are many walls
Hear the peasants come and crawl
You can hear their numbers called

Candy and Taffy, hope you both are well
Please come see me in the citadel

Screaming people fly so fast
In their shiny metal cars
Through the woods of steel and glass

Candy and Taffy, hope you both are well
Please come see me in the citadel
Oh well!

In another land where the breeze and the
Trees and flowers were blue
I stood and held your hand
And the grass grew high and the feathers floated by
I stood and held your hand

And nobody else's hand will ever do
Nobody else will do
Then I awoke
Was this some kind of joke?
Much to my surprise
I opened my eyes

We walked across the sand and the sea and
The sky and the castles were blue
I stood and held your hand
And the spray flew high and the feathers floated by
I stood and held your hand

And nobody else's hand will ever do
Nobody else will do
Then I awoke
Was this some kind of joke?
Much to my surprise
When I opened my eyes

We heard the trumpets blow and the sky
Turned red when I accidentally said
That I didn't know how I came to be here
Not fast asleep in bed
I stood and held your hand

And nobody else's hand will ever do
Nobody else's hand
Then I awoke
Was this some kind of joke?
I opened my eyes
Much to my surprise

Well, my name is a number
A piece of plastic film
And I'm growin' funny flowers
In my little window sill

Don't you know I'm a 2,000 man
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all

Well my wife still respects me
I really misused her
I am having an affair
With the Random computer

Don't you know I'm a 2,000 man
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all

Oh daddy, proud of your planet
Oh mummy, proud of your sun
Oh daddy, proud of your planet
Oh mummy, proud of your sun

Oh daddy, your brain's still flashing
Like it did when you were young
Or do you come down crashin'
Seeing all the things you'd done
All was a big put on

Oh daddy, proud of your planet
Oh mummy, proud of your sun
Oh daddy, proud of your planet
Oh mummy, proud of your sun

Oh daddy, proud of your planet
Oh mummy, proud of your sun
Oh daddy, proud of your planet
Oh mummy, proud of your sun

And you know who's the 2000 man
And your kids they just won't understand you at all

Why don't we sing this song all together
Open our minds let the pictures come
And if we close all our eyes together
Then we will see where we all come from
Pictures of us in the circling sun
Pictures of the show that we're all one

She comes in colours ev'rywhere
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Coming, colours in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colours

She comes in colours ev'rywhere
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Coming, colours in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colours

Have you seen her dressed in blue?
See the sky in front of you
And her face is like a sail
Speck of white so fair and pale
Have you seen a lady fairer?

She comes in colours ev'rywhere
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Coming, colours in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colours

Have you seen her all in gold?
Like a queen in days of old
She shoots colours all around
Like a sunset going down
Have you seen a lady fairer?

She comes in colours ev'rywhere
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Coming, colours in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colours

She's like a rainbow
Coming, colours in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colours

We, in our present life
Knew that the stars were right
That if you are the first to go
You'll leave a sign to let me know
Tell me so

Please, carry the Lantern lights

You crossed the sea of night
Free from the spell of fright
Your cloak it is a spirit shroud
You'll wake me in my sleeping hours
Like a cloud

So, please, carry the Lantern high

Me, in my sorry plight
You waiting every night
My face it turns a deathly pale
You're talking to me, through your veil
I hear you wail

So, please carry the Lantern light

The servants sleep
The door's are barred
You hear the stopping of my heart-we never part

So, please carry the Lantern high

By the lake with lily flowers
While away the evening hours

To and fro she's gently gliding
On the glassy lake she's riding

She swims to the side
The sun sees her dried

The birds hover high
I'd stifle a cry

The birds hover high
She moans with a sigh

Sun turnin' 'round with graceful motion
We're setting off with soft explosion
Bound for a star with fiery oceans
It's so very lonely, you're a hundred light years from home

Freezing red deserts turn to dark
Energy here in every part
It's so very lonely, you're six hundred light years from home

It's so very lonely, you're a thousand light years from home
It's so very lonely, you're a thousand light years from home

Bell flight fourteen you now can land
See you on Aldebaran, safe on the green desert sand
It's so very lonely, you're two thousand light years from home
It's so very lonely, you're two thousand light years from home

Good evening one and all, we're all so glad to see you here
We'll play your favourite songs while you all soak up the atmosphere
We'll start with 'Old Man River', then maybe 'Stormy Weather', too
I'm sure you know just what to do
On with the show, good health to you

Please pour another glass, it's time to watch the cabaret
Your wife will never know that you're not really working late
Your hostess here is Wendy, you'll find her very friendly, too
And we don't care just what you do
On with the show good health to you

Betina starts the show at 2 o'clock

Oh, if by chance you find that you can't make it anymore
We'll put you in a cab and get you safely to the door
But we've got all the answers and we've got lovely dancers, too
There's nothin' else you have to do
On with the show, good health to you

You're all such lovely people dancing, eating 'round the floor
But if you have to fight, please take your trouble out the door
For now I say with sorrow until this time tomorrow
We'll bid you all a fond adieu
On with the show, good health to you

Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith

I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game

I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Tzar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain

I rode a tank
Held a general's rank
When the blitzkrieg raged
And the bodies stank

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah

I watched with glee
While your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades
For the gods they made

I shouted out,
"Who killed the Kennedys?"
When after all
It was you and me

Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah, get down, hit it

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
But what's confusing you
Is just the nature of my game

Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails
Just call me Lucifer
Cause I'm in need of some restraint

So if you meet me
Have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste

Um yeah
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, um yeah
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game

Um mean it, get down

Woo, who
Oh yeah, get on down

Oh yeah
Oh yeah!
Tell me baby, what's my name
Tell me honey, can ya guess my name

Tell me baby, what's my name
I tell you one time, you're to blame
Ooo, who
Ooo, who

Ooo, who
Ooo, who, who
Ooo, who, who
Ooo, who, who

Ooo, who, who
Oh, yeah
What's my name
Tell me, baby, what's my name

Tell me, sweetie, what's my name
Ooo, who, who
Ooo, who, who
Ooo, who, who

Ooo, who, who
Ooo, who, who
Ooo, who, who
Ooo, who, who

Oh, yeah

Take me to the station
And put me on a train
I've got no expectations
To pass through here again

Once I was a rich man
Now I am so poor
But never in my sweet short life
Have I felt like this before

Your heart is like a diamond
You throw your pearls at swine
And as I watch you leaving me
You pack my peace of mind

Our love was like the water
That splashes on a stone
Our love is like our music
It's here, and then it's gone

So take me to the airport
And put me on a plane
I got no expectations
To pass through here again

Oh help me, please doctor, I'm damaged
There's a pain where there once was a heart
It's sleeping, it's a-beatin'
Can't you please tear it out, and preserve it
Right there in that jar?

Oh help me, please mama, I'm sick'ning
It's today that's the day of the plunge
Oh the gal I'm to marry
Is a bow-legged sow
I've been soakin' up drink like a sponge

"Don't you worry, get dressed," cried my mother
As she plied me with bourbon so sour
"Pull your socks up, put your suit on
Comb your long hair down
For you will be wed in the hour."

So help me, please doctor, I'm damaged
There's a pain where there once was a heart
I'm sleeping, it's beatin'
Can't you please take it out, and preserve it
Right there in that jar?

yep

Oh help me, please doctor, I'm damaged
There's a pain where there once was a heart
It's sleeping, it's a-beatin'
Can't you please tear it out, and preserve it
Right there in that jar?

I was tremblin', as I put on my jacket
It had creases as sharp as a knife
I put the ring in my pocket
But there was a note
And my heart it jumped into my mouth

It read, "Darlin', I'm sorry to hurt you
But I've no courage to speak to your face
But I'm down in Virginia with your cousin Lou
There'll be no wedding today."

So help me, please doctor, I'm damaged
You can put back my heart in its hole
Oh mama, I'm cryin'
Tears of relief
And my pulse is now under control
Yeah

Parachute woman, land on me tonight
Parachute woman, land on me tonight
I'll break big in New Orleans
And I'll overspill in Caroline

Parachute woman, join me for a ride
Parachute woman, join me for a ride
I'll make my play in Dallas
And get hot again in half the time

Babe

Parachute woman, will you blow me out?
Parachute woman, will you blow me out?
Well, my heavy throbber's itching
Just to lay a solid rhythm down

Here

There's a tramp sittin' on my doorstep
Tryin' to waste his time
With his methylated sandwich
He's a walking clothesline
And here comes the bishop's daughter
On the other side
And she looks a trifle jealous
She's been an outcast all her life

Me, I'm waiting so patiently
Lying on the floor
I'm just trying to do my jig-saw puzzle
Before it rains anymore

Oh the gangster looks so fright'ning
With his Luger in his hand
But when he gets home to his children
He's a family man
But when it comes to the nitty-gritty
He can shove in his knife
Yes he really looks quite religious
He's been an outlaw all his life

Me, I'm waiting so patiently
Lying on the floor
I'm just trying to do this jig-saw puzzle
Before it rains anymore

Yes, yes now
Oh, all right

Me, I'm waiting so patiently
Lying on the floor
I'm just trying to do this jig-saw puzzle
Before it rains anymore

Oh the singer, he looks angry
At being thrown to the lions
And the bass player, he looks nervous
About the girls outside
And the drummer, he's so shattered
Trying to keep up time
And the guitar players look damaged
They've been outcasts all their lives

Me, I'm waiting so patiently
Lying on the floor
I'm just trying to do this jig-saw puzzle
Before it rains anymore

Oh, there's twenty-thousand grandmas
Wave their hankies in the air
All burning up their pensions
And shouting, "It's not fair!"
There's a regiment of soldiers
Standing looking on
And the queen is bravely shouting,
"What the hell is going on?"

With a blood-curdling "tally-ho"
She charged into the ranks
And blessed all those grandmas who
With their dying breaths screamed, "Thanks!"

Me, I'm just waiting so patiently
With my woman on the floor
We're just trying to do this jig-saw puzzle
Before it rains anymore

Ev'rywhere I hear the sound of marching charging feet, boy
'Cause summer's here and the time is right for fighting in the street, boy

Well now what can a poor boy do
Except to sing for a rock n' roll band?
'Cause in sleepy London town
There's just no place for a street fighting man
No

Hey think the time is right for a palace revolution
But where I live the game to play is compromise solution

Well now what can a poor boy do
Except to sing for a rock n' roll band?
'Cause in sleepy London town
There's just no place for a street fighting man
No

(Get down)

Hey so my name is called Disturbance
I'll shout and scream, I'll kill the king, I'll rail at all his servants

Well now what can a poor boy do
Except to sing for a rock n' roll band?
'Cause in sleepy London town
There's just no place for a street fighting man
No

(Get down)

Well a poor boy took his father's bread and started down the road
Started down the road
Took all he had and started down the road
Going out in this world, where God only knows
And that'll be the way to get along

Well poor boy spent all he had, famine come in the land
Famine come in the land
Spent all he had and famine come in the land
Said, "I believe I'll go and hire me to some man
And that'll be the way I'll get along."

Well, man said, "I'll give you a job for to feed my swine
For to feed my swine
I'll give you a job for to feed my swine"
Boy stood there and hung his head and cried
Cause that is no way to get along

Said, "I believe I'll ride, believe I'll go back home
Believe I'll go back home
Believe I'll ride, believe I'll go back home
Or down the road as far as I can go"
And that'll be the way to get along

Well, father said, "See my son coming after me
Coming home to me"
Father ran and fell down on his knees
Said, "Sing and praise, Lord have mercy on me"
Mercy

Oh poor boy stood there, hung his head and cried
Hung his head and cried
Poor boy stood and hung his head and cried
Said, "Father will you look on me as a child?"
Yeah

Well father said, "Eldest son, kill the fatted calf,
Call the family round
Kill that calf and call the family round
My son was lost but now he is found
Cause that's the way for us to get along"

Hey

Ah... hey
Yeah, cat's own tail

I hear the click-clack of your feet on the stairs
I know you're no scare-eyed honey
There'll be a feast if you just come upstairs

But it's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

I can see that you're fifteen years old
No, I don't want your I.D
And I can see that you're so far from home

But that's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
Oh yeah, don't you scratch like that
Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
I bet, bet your mama don't know you scream like that
I bet your mother don't know you can spit like that

You look so weird and you're so far from home
But you really miss your mother
Don't look so scared I'm no mad-brained bear

But but it's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

Oh, yeah
Woo!

I bet your mama don't know that you scratch like that
I bet she don't know you can bite like that

You say you got a friend, that she's wilder than you
Why don't you bring her upstairs?
If she's so wild then she can join in too

It's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
Oh yeah, don't you scratch like that
Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
I bet you mama don't know you can bite like that
I'll bet she never saw you scratch my back

Waiting for a girl who's got curlers in her hair
Waiting for a girl she has no money anywhere
We get buses everywhere

Waiting for a factory girl

Waiting for a girl and her knees are much too fat
Waiting for a girl who wears scarves instead of hats
Her zipper's broken down the back

Waiting for a factory girl

Waiting for a girl and she gets me into fights
Waiting for a girl we get drunk on Friday night
She's a sight for sore eyes

Waiting for a factory girl

Waiting for a girl she's got stains all down her dress
Waiting for a girl and my feet are getting wet
She ain't come out yet

Waiting for a factory girl

Let's drink to the hard-working people
Let's drink to the lowly of birth
Raise your glass to the good and the evil
Let's drink to the salt of the earth

Say a prayer for the common-foot soldier
Spare a thought for his back-breaking work
Say a prayer for his wife and his children
Who burn the fires and who still till the earth

When I search a faceless crowd
A swirling mass of gray and black and white
They don't look real to me
In fact, they look so strange

Raise your glass to the hard-working people
Let's drink to the uncounted heads
Let's think of the wavering millions
Who need leading but get gamblers instead

Spare a thought for the stay-at-home voter
Empty eyes gaze at strange beauty shows
And a parade of the gray-suited grafters
A choice of cancer or polio

When I look in the faceless crowd
A swirling mass of grays and black and white
They don't look real to me
Oh don't they look so strange?

Let's drink to the hard-working people
Let's think of the lowly of birth
Spare a thought for the rag taggy people
Let's drink to the salt of the earth

Let's drink to the hard-working people
Let's drink to the salt of the earth
Let's drink to the two thousand million
Let's think of the humble of birth

Let's take a drink to the salt of the earth
Let's take a drink to the salt of the earth
Let's take a drink to the salt of the earth
Let's take a drink to the salt of the earth
Let's take a drink to the salt of the earth
Let's take a drink to the salt of the earth
Let's take a drink to the salt of the earth
Let's take a drink to the salt of the earth

Oh, a storm is threat'ning
My very life today
If I don't get some shelter
Oh yeah, I'm gonna fade away

War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

Ooh, see the fire is sweepin'
Our very street today
Burns like a red coal carpet
Mad bull lost your way

War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

Rape, murder!
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
Rape, murder!
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
Rape, murder!
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

The floods is threat'ning
My very life today
Gimme, gimme shelter
Or I'm gonna fade away

War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

I tell you love, sister, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
Kiss away, kiss away

Well I followed her to the station
With a suitcase in my hand
Yeah, I followed her to the station
With a suitcase in my hand

Whoa, it's hard to tell, it's hard to tell
When all your love's in vain

When the train come in the station
I looked her in the eye
Well the train come in the station
And I looked her in the eye

Whoa, I felt so sad so lonesome
That I could not help but cry

When the train left the station
It had two lights on behind
Yeah, when the train left the station
It had two lights on behind

Whoa, the blue light was my baby
And the red light was my mind

All my love's in vain
All my love's in vain

I'm sittin' in a bar tipplin' a jar in Jackson
And on the street the summer sun it shines
There's many a bar-room queen I've had in Jackson
But I just can't seem to drink you off my mind

It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

I laid a divorcee in New York City
I had to put up some kind of a fight
The lady she all dressed me up in roses
She blew my nose and then she blew my mind

It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

Ah yes
Woo!
All right

It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

All over

It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues
I got nasty habits, I take tea at three
Yes, and the meat I eat for dinner
It must be hung up for a week

My best friend, he shoots water rats
And feeds them to his geese
Don't you think there's a place for you
In between the sheets?

Come on now, honey
We can build a home for three
Come on now, honey
Don't you wanna live with me?

And there's a score of harebrained children
They're all locked in the nursery
They got earphone heads they got dirty necks
They're so 20th century

Well they queue up for the bathroom
'Round about 7:35
Don't you think we need a woman's touch
To make it come alive?

You'd look good pram-pushing
Down the high street
Come on now, honey
Don't you wanna live with me?

Whoa, the servants they're so helpful, dear
The cook she is a whore
Yes, the butler has a place for her
Behind the pantry door

The maid, she's French, she's got no sense
She's wild the Crazy Horse
And when she strips, the chauffeur flips
The footman's eyes get crossed

Don't you think there's a place for us
Right across the street
Don't you think there's a place for you
In between the sheets?

Well, we all need someone we can lean on
And if you want it, well, you can lean on me
Yeah, we all need someone we can lean on
And if you want it, well, you can lean on me

She said, "My breasts, they will always be open
Baby, you can rest your weary head right on me
And there will always be a space in my parking lot
When you need a little coke and sympathy"

Yeah, we all need someone we can dream on
And if you want it, baby, well you can dream on me
Yeah, we all need someone we can cream on
And if you want to, well you can cream on me

I was dreaming of a steel guitar engagement
When you drunk my health in scented jasmine tea
But you knifed me in my dirty filthy basement
With that jaded, faded, junky nurse
Oh what pleasant company
Come on

We all need someone we can feed on
And if you want it, well you can feed on me

Take my arm, take my leg, oh baby don't you take my head

Yeah, we all need someone we can bleed on
Yeah, and if you want it, baby, well you can bleed on me
Yeah, we all need someone we can bleed on
Yeah, yeah, and if you want it, baby, why don't you bleed on me

All over

Come on, babe

Ah, bleed it alright, bleed it alright, bleed it alright
You can bleed all over me
Bleed it alright, bleed it alright, you can be my rider
You can cum all over me

Bleed it alright, baby, bleed it alright, bleed it alright
You can cum all over me

Bleed it alright, baby cum all over me
Bleed it alright
Bleed it alright

Did you hear about the midnight rambler?
Everybody got to go
Did you hear about the midnight rambler?
The one that shut the kitchen door

He don't give a hoot of warning
Wrapped up in a black cat cloak
He don't go in the light of the morning
He split the time the cock'rel crows

Talkin' about the midnight gambler
The one you never seen before
Yeah, talkin' about the midnight gambler
Did you see him jump the garden wall?

Sighin' down the wind so sadly
Listen and you'll hear him moan
Yeah, well I'm talkin' about the midnight gambler
Everybody got to go

Yes

Did you hear about the midnight rambler?
Well, honey, it's no rock 'n' roll show
Well, I'm talkin' about the midnight gambler
Yeah, the one you never seen before

Don't do that, don't do that, don't do that
Don't do that, don't do that
Don't do that, don't do that
Don't do that, don't do that
Don't do that, don't do that
Don't do that, don't do that
Don't do that, don't you do that
Don't you, don't you do that

Don't do that
Don't do that
Don't you do that
Don't you do that
Don't you do that

Don't you, don't you do that
Don't you, don't you do that
Don't you, don't you do that
Don't you, don't you do that

Oh don't do that
Oh don't do that
Oh don't do that
Oh don't do that
Oh don't do that
Oh don't do that
Oh don't do that
Oh don't do that
Oh don't do that
Oh don't do that

Well you heard about the Boston
It's not one of those
Well, talkin' 'bout the midnight...sh
The one that closed the bedroom door

I'm called the hit-and-run raper in anger
The knife-sharpened tippie-toe
Or just the shoot 'em dead, brainbell jangler
You know, the one you never seen before

So if you ever meet the midnight rambler
Coming down your marble hall
Well he's pouncing like a proud black panther
Well, you can say I, I told you so

Well, don't you listen for the midnight rambler
Play it easy, as you go
I'm gonna smash down all your plate glass windows
Put a fist, put a fist through your steel-plated door

Did you hear about the midnight rambler?
He'll leave his footprints up and down your hall
And did you hear about the midnight gambler?
And did you see me make my midnight call?

And if you ever catch the midnight rambler
I'll steal your mistress from under your nose
I'll go easy with your cold fanged anger
I'll stick my knife right down your throat, baby
And it hurts!

Hey babe, what's in your eyes?
I saw them flashing like airplane lights
You fill my cup, babe, that's for sure
I must come back for a little more

You got my heart you got my soul
You got the silver you got the gold
You got the diamonds from the mine
Well that's all right, it'll buy some time

Tell me, honey, what will I do
When I'm hungry and thirsty too
Feeling foolish (and that's for sure)
Just waiting here at your kitchen door?

Hey baby, what's in your eyes?
Is that the diamonds from the mine?
What's that laughing in your smile?
I don't care, no, I don't care

Oh babe, you got my soul
You got the silver you got the gold
If that's your love, just leave me blind
I don't care, no, that's no big surprise

I'm a fleabit peanut monkey
All my friends are junkies
That's not really true

I'm a cold Italian pizza
I could use a lemon squeezer
Would you do?

But I've been bit and I've been tossed around
By every she-rat in this town
Have you, babe?

Well, I am just a monkey man
I'm glad you are a monkey woman too

I was bitten by a boar
I was gouged and I was gored
But I pulled on through

Yes, I'm a sack of broken eggs
I always have an unmade bed
Don't you?

Well, I hope we're not too messianic
Or a trifle too satanic
We love to play the blues

Well I am just a monkey man
I'm glad you are a monkey, monkey woman too, babe

I'm a monkey! I'm a monkey!
I'm a monkey man! I'm a monkey man!
I'm a monkey! I'm a monkey! I'm a monkey! I'm a monkey!
M-m-m-monkey! M-m-m-m-monkey! I'm a m-m-m-monkey!
M-m-m-ma ma ma ma!
Ma ma ma ma ma
Ma ma ma ma ma monkey!
Ah! I'm a monkey!
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

I saw her today at the reception
A glass of wine in her hand
I knew she would meet her connection
At her feet was a footloose man

No, you can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometime you find
You get what you need

I saw her today at the reception
A glass of wine in her hand
I knew she was gonna meet her connection
At her feet was a footloose man

You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes, well, you might find
You get what you need

And I went down to the demonstration
To get my fair share of abuse
Singing, "We're gonna vent our frustration
If we don't we're gonna blow a 50-amp fuse"

Sing it to me, honey

You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes, well, you just might find
You get what you need

Oh baby, yeah

I went down to the Chelsea drugstore
To get your prescription filled
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy
And man, did he look pretty ill

We decided that we would have a soda
My favorite flavor, cherry red
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy
Yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was "dead"

I said to him

You can't always get what you want
Well no
You can't always get what you want
I tell you, baby
You can't always get what you want
No
But if you try sometimes you just might find
You get what you need

Oh, yeah, woo

You get what you need
Yeah, oh baby

I saw her today at the reception
In her glass was a bleeding man
She was practiced at the art of deception
Well I could tell by her blood-stained hands

Sing it

You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want, ooh yeah, child
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes you just might find
You just might find
You get what you need

Ah yeah
Ah yeah, woo!

Ah, you can't always get what you want
(No no, baby)
You can't always get what you want
(You can't now now)
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometime you just might find
You just might find
That you get what you need

Ah yeah!
Ah yeah! Do that
