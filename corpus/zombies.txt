Cause the road runner honey
Baby that’s all I am to you
Yeah the road runner honey
Now I know that, that’s true
Move over baby, I’m going to drive
Oh, oh

Cause the road runner honey
Baby that’s all I am to you
Yeah the road runner honey
Now I can see that it’s true
No
Move over baby, I’m going to drive
No

Cause the road runner honey
Baby that’s all I am to you
Yeah the road runner honey
Now I can see that, that’s true
Move over baby, I’m going to drive


Its summertime, and living is easy.
The fish are jumping and the cotton is high.
Your daddy's rich and your momma's good looking.
Won't you hush pretty baby, don't you cry.

One of these mornings, you're gonna wake up singing.
Than you're gonna spread you're wings, and take to the sky

But 'till that morning, ain't nothing, nothing gonna harm you
With your mommy and daddy, they're standin' by

Its summertime, and living is easy.
The fish are jumping and the cotton is high.
Your daddy's rich and your momma's good looking.
Won't you hush pretty baby, don't you cry.


I can't make up my mind; someone has to help me
I never seem to know what to do; I just can't decide for myself
She has told me in so many words that she's still in love with me
& she wants me back, she wants me back with her again

[Chorus:]
She said, "Why don't you come back home to me?
Why don't you come back, come back where you belong?
I need you here
Why don't you come back home to me?
Why don't you come back, come back where you belong?
I want you by my side"

Someone show me which way to go; I need guiding in my choice
Of what to do; someone has to help me

[Instrumental]

[repeat chorus & last verse]


Should I try to hide the way I feel inside my heart for you?
Would you say that you would try to love me too?
In your mind could you ever be really close to me?
I can tell the way you smile, if I feel that I could be certain
Then I would say the things, I want to say tonight

But till I can see that you'd really care for me
I will dream that someday you'll be really close to me
I can tell the way you smile if I feel that I could be certain
Then I would say the things I want to say tonight

But till I can see that you'd really care for me
I'll keep trying to hide the way I feel inside


I don't like you
But I love you
Seems that I'm always
Thinking of you
Oh, oh, oh
You treat me badly
I love you madly
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I don't want you
But I need you
Don't want to kiss you
But I need you
Oh, oh, oh
You do me wrong now
My love is strong now
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Tied up
Tied up

I want to leave you
Don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend
Another day here
Oh, oh, oh, I want to split now
I just can quit now
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me

You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me


Well, no one told me about her
The way she lied
Well, no one told me about her
How many people cried

But it's too late to say you're sorry
How would I know? Why should I care?
Please don't bother trying to find her
She's not there

Well, let me tell you 'bout the way she looked
The way she acts and the color of her hair
Her voice was soft and cool
Her eyes were clear and bright
But she's not there

Well, no one told me about her
What could I do?
Well, no one told me about her
Though they all knew

But it's too late to say you're sorry
How would I know? Why should I care?
Please don't bother trying to find her
She's not there

Well, let me tell you 'bout the way she looked
The way she acts and the color of her hair
Her voice was soft and cool
Her eyes were clear and bright
But she's not there

But it's too late to say you're sorry
How would I know? Why should I care?
Please don't bother trying to find her
She's not there

Well, let me tell you about the way she looked
The way she acts and the color of her hair
Her voice was soft and cool
Her eyes were clear and bright
But she's not there


People talk about breaking off
Can't let us be
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But talk don't bother me

People talk about breaking off
Scatter up my name
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But I'll never be the same

I've been abused
In my home
I've been abused
I've been abused right from the start

People talk about breaking off
Can't let us be
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But talk don't bother me
Oh, oh, oh

I've been abused
Out of my home
I've been abused
I've been abused right from the start

People talk about breaking off
Can't let us be
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But talk don't bother me
Oh, oh, oh

I've been abused
In my home
I've been abused
I've been abused right from the start

People talk about breaking off
Can't let us be
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But talk don't bother me


Can't nobody love you
Like I'm loving you baby
Cause they don't know how
To love you like I do

Can't nobody love you
Like I'm loving you right now
Cause they don't know how
To love you like I do

I'm going to love you in the morning
Love you late at night
I ain't going to stop loving you
Till you tell me everything's alright

Can't nobody love you
Like I'm loving you right now
Cause they don't know how
To love you like I do

Can't nobody kiss you
(Can't nobody kiss you)
Like I'm kissing you right now little girl
Cause they don't know how to kiss you
Like I do
(Can't nobody love you)
And ain't nobody that can talk to you
Like I'm talking to you right now
Cause they don't know how to talk to you
Like I do

Listen now
Sam bought you cake and ice cream
Called you cherry pie
Ray Charles called you his sunshine
But you're the apple
Apple of my eye, oh

Can't nobody love you
(Can't nobody love you)
Like I'm loving you right now
Cause they don't know how to love you
Like I do
No they don't know how
To love you
Like I do


Woman
When I walked with you last night
My mind
Saw that you'd soon hold me tight

I can't concede, no
I can't believe you love me too

You don't
Realize what you can do
I just sympathize but still it's true

I can't concede, no
I can't believe you love me too

Woman
When I walked with you last night
My mind
Saw that you'd soon hold me tight

I can't concede, no
I can't believe you love me too

No, no, no

I want you to understand my mind
Seems that girls that do are hard to find

I can't concede, no
I can't believe you love me too


If you can't find better things to do
Than tell me stories about her that you think are true
I don't wanna hear anything about her that's bad
I don't wanna hear anything that makes me sad
I don't want to know (I don't want to know)
I don't want to know (I don't want to know)
I don't want to know; you'd better turn around & go
I don't want to know

I don't wanna listen; I'm not gonna hear you
I believe what I want, no matter what you do
[x3]
I don't care, don't want another word of anything you say
I don't wanna hear anything; you just keep away
I don't want to know (I don't want to know)
I don't want to know (I don't want to know)
I don't want to know; you'd better turn around & go
I don't want to know


She seems so cold to me
And I remember when I loved her
She seems so cold to me
But I remember when I loved her

Now we are strange
No more in love
But I still wish
That I could hold her

My dream of love has gone
And I remember when I loved her

Now we are strange
No more in love
But I still wish
That I could hold her

My dream of love has gone
And I remember when I loved her
When I loved her
When I loved
Her


What more can I do
You know I'd gladly lose myself to you
But something always holds me back
I wish I knew what it is that stops me from loving you
The way it should be
Oh, oh, oh

What more can I do
I'm trying hard, I know I could believe in you
But something always keeps a hold on me, and just won't let me go
Such a burning bully inside
While I'm trying to hide that I want you to own me, own me
Oh -oh, oh, yeah

What more can I say, I've said it all now
Got such a lot to lose and price to pay
If you ignore me, what more can I do
(What more can I do)
Oh
What more can I do
(Oooh)
Oh
What more can I do


I got my mojo working, it just don't work on you. 
I got my mojo working, but it just don't work on you. 
Look out baby, 
Gonna circle the blues. 
Got your gypsy woman, giving me advice. 
Got a gypsy woman, giving me advice. 
Got a whole lot of tricks, 
Keep you here all night. 
Awww... 
Yeah... 
Can you hear me? 
Can you hear me? 
Wooo... 
Got a gypsy woman, giving me advice. 
I got a gypsy woman, giving me advice. 
Got a whole lot of tricks, 
Keeping me here all night. 
I got my mojo working, 
I got my mojo working, 
I got my mojo working, 
Got my mojo working, 
Got my mojo working, 
Just don't work on you. 
I got my mojo working, 
I got my mojo working, 
I got my mojo working, 
Got my mojo working, 
Got my mojo working, 
Let me hear you. 
Got my mojo working, 
Got my mojo working, 
Got my mojo working, 
Got my mojo working, 
Got my mojo working, everybody. 
Just don't work on you. 
Wooo.... 
I got my mojo working, 
I got my mojo working, 
I got my mojo working, 
I got my mojo working, 
Got my mojo working, everybody. 
Just don't, just don't, work on you.


If you wanna mess around just stay away from my door
I got a leak in my bucket and a great big hole in my floor
But if you wanna stay around and love me
You know it's all right with me

I've got no money can't afford no big black car
The bank account won't see me very far
But if you wanna stay around and love me
You know it's all right with me
I'm sick and tired of being on my own
But you know I'll take nobody
Who's gonna leave me tired and alone

So you see I can only offer a man that's poor
With frost in bed and trouble at my door
But if you wanna stay around and love me
You know it's all right with me
Oooooh Oooooh


Sometimes I feel a little a little lonely
Well, don't you know that sometimes (I feel a little lonely)
& don't you know that sometimes (I cry at night)
But I just have to hold you (I just have to hold you)
& I know it's all right (I know it's all right)

When I'm so happy when I'm with you
When I touch you, all my feelin's can't describe
All the love I feel for you
But I just wake up in the mornin'
& I wonder if this love is real
I've been hurt so many times before
But now I know, I know this love is real
Then sometimes I wonder (I feel a little lonely)
I really do (I cry at night)
But I just have to hold you (I just have to hold you)
& I know it's you (I know it's you)
[x2]


The kind of girl 
Who says to me
She doesn't want my love
Is not the kind of girl
That you tell me
I should be thinking of

But more of that another day
I've found another child
To share with me
All of the pleasures that you've enjoyed

But don't you think
That you're forgiven
For taking her away
For if it hadn't been
For your deceit
I'd be holding her today 

You think you've got everything, 
Just because you hold her
In your arms, and squeeze her tight
Don't you understand that she 
Runs away with anyone who happens in her sight, oh

You can see how hot she is
You'd think you're very wise
But she will run away from you
Before you realize

You think you've got everything, 
Just because you hold her
In your arms, and squeeze her tight
Don't you understand that she 
Runs away with anyone who happens in her sight, oh

You can see how hot she is
You'd think you're very wise
But she will run away from you
Before you realize (ohoh)
She's gone, She's gone


And if she should tell you "come closer"
And if she tempts you with her charms

Tell her no  no  no  no  no-no-no-no
No  no  no  no  no-no-no-no
No no no no no
Don't hurt me now for her love belongs to me

And if she should tell you "I love you", whoa-oh-oh
And if she tempts you with her charms

Tell her no  no  no  no  no-no-no-no
No  no  no  no  no-no-no-no
(Don't let her love for your arms)
No no no no no
Don't hurt me now for her love belongs to me

I know she's a kind of girl
Who'd throw my love away
But I still love her so
Don't hurt me now, don't hurt me now

If she tells you "I love you" whoa-oh-oh
Just remember she said that to me

Tell her no  no  no  no  no-no-no-no
No  no  no  no  no-no-no-no
(Don't take her love from my arms)
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
Don't leave me now for her love belongs to me


I know this girl
And know you well
You want her now
She needs you now
No matter where you go
No matter what you do
She'll be for you
I know she will
I know she will

Take my advice
Treat her good, treat her right
Smile for her
She'll be your world
No matter where you go
No matter what you do
She'll be for you
I know she will
I know she will

She told me how she longed for you
Asked me what to do
And I'm wondering how to
Make you see
All you've got to say
Make her come your way
And I know she will

Just take her hand
She'll go with you
Warm to her

She'll be your world
No matter where you go
No matter what you do
She'll be for you
I know she will
I know she will

No matter where you go
No matter what you do
She'll be for you
I know she will
I know she will

She told me how she longed for you
Asked me what to do
And I'm wondering how to
Make you see
All you've got to say
Make her come your way
And I know she will

Just take her hand
She'll go with you
Warm to her

She'll be your world
No matter where you go
No matter what you do
She'll be for you
I know she will
I know she will, yeah


In the night you'll hear me crying
That's because I'm sad that I'm away from you
If there's something on my mind
Take no notice 
No, I'm just trying to think of something else

If I weren't, that's my business
Anytime I want to cry
If I want to feed this sickness
Keep away from me
Cause I'll keep trying till you come on home
(Keep trying)
Keep trying (keep trying)  
Till my time has come
Keep trying till you come on home to me

You thought you could throw away
Everything I gave you just a say a word
Can't you see that you were wrong
Can't you see I knew how long you'd lied and cheated

If I weren't, that's my business
Anytime I want to cry
If I want to feed this sickness
Keep away from me
Cause I'll keep trying till you come on home
(Keep trying)
Keep trying (keep trying)  
Till my time has come
Keep trying till you come on home to me

If I weren't, that's my business
Anytime I want to cry
If I want to feed this sickness
Keep away from me
Cause I'll keep trying till you come on home
(Keep trying)
Keep trying (keep trying)  
Till my time has come
Keep trying till you come on home to me


Good morning to you I hope you're feeling better baby
Thinking of me while you are far away
Counting the days until they set you free again
Writing this letter hoping you're okay

Saved you the room you used to stay in every Sunday
The one that is warmed by sunshine every day
And we'll get to know each other for a second time
And then you can tell me 'bout your prison stay...

Feels so good...
You're coming home soon!

It's gonna to be good to have you back again with me
Watching the laughter play around your eyes
Come up and fetch you, saved up for the train fare money
Kiss and make up and it will be so nice...

Feels so good...
You're coming home soon!

Walking the way we used to walk 
And it could be so nice...
We're talking the way we used to talk 
And it could be so nice...

It's gonna be good to have you back again with me
Watching the laughter play around your eyes
Come up and fetch you, saved up for the train fare money
Kiss and make up and it will be so nice...

Feels so good...
You're coming home soon!
Feels so good...
You're coming home soon!


The summer is here at last
The sky is overcast
And no one brings a rose for Emily

She watches her flowers grow
While lovers come and go
To give each other roses from her tree
But not a rose for Emily...

Emily, can't you see (how the sun is shining again)
There's nothing you can do?
There's loving everywhere
But none for you...

Her roses are fading now
She keeps her pride somehow
That's all she has protecting her from pain

And as the years go by
She will grow old and die
The roses in her garden fade away
Not one left for her grave
Not a rose for Emily...

Emily, can't you see (how the sun is shining again)
There's nothing you can do?
There's loving everywhere
But none for you...

Her roses are fading now
She keeps her pride somehow
That's all she has protecting her from pain

And as the years go by
She will grow old and die
The roses in her garden fade away
Not one left for her grave
Not a rose for Emily...


She told me she loved me
With words as soft as morning rain
But the light that fell upon me
Turned to shadow when he came

Maybe after he's gone
She'll come back
Love me again
Maybe after he's gone
She'll come back
Want me again

I remember joy and pain
Her smile, her tears are part of me
I feel I'll never breathe again
I feel life's gone from me

Maybe after he's gone
She'll come back
Love me again
Maybe after he's gone
She'll come back
Want me again

All the days and all the nights
Are time just passing by
And all the dreams I'm dreaming now
Hide the tears that I cry

I feel so cold, I'm on my own
As the night folds in around me
Night surrounds me, I'm alone

Maybe after he's gone
She'll come back
Love me again
Maybe after he's gone
She'll come back
Want me again


Do you remember summer days
Just after summer rain
When all the air was damp and warm 
In the green of country lanes?
And the breeze would touch your hair
Kiss your face and make you care
About your world
Your summer world
And we would count the evening stars 
As the day grew dark
In Beechwood Park...

Do you remember golden days and golden summer sun
The sound of laughter in our ears
In the breeze as we would run?
And the breeze would touch your hair
Kiss your face and make you care
About your world
Your summer world
And we would count the evening stars
As the day grew dark
In Beechwood Park...

Oh roads in my mind
Take me back in my mind
And I can't forget you
Won't forget you
Won't forget those days
And Beechwood Park...

And the breeze would touch your hair
Kiss your face and make you care
About your world
Your summer world
And we would count the evening stars
As the day grew dark
In Beechwood Park...

Oh roads in my mind
Take me back in my mind
And I can't forget you
Won't forget you
Won't forget those days
And Beechwood Park...


There she sits her hands are held
Tight around her glass
She only needs to be alone
She knows this mood will pass
To realize that she was strong
And he too weak to stay
And to realize that she is better off this way

Brief candles in her mind
Bright and tiny gems of memory
Brief candles burn so fine
Leaves a light inside where she can see
What makes it all worthwhile
Her sadness makes her smile...

His alone girl fades away
Left out on a limb
Finds he needs her more because
She's no more need for him
He understood so very well
The things she had to say
Soon he'll understand that he is better off this way

Brief candles in his mind
Bright and tiny gems of memory
Brief candles burn so fine
Leaves a light inside where he can see
What makes it all worthwhile
His sadness makes him smile...

In the corner see his face
The man just sips his drink
Not one feeling does he show 
Far too numb to think
He does not say a single word
No word of love to say
Maybe he will soon believe he's better off this way...

Brief candles in his mind
Bright and tiny gems of memory
Brief candles burn so fine
Leaves a light inside where he can see
What makes it all worthwhile
His sadness makes him smile...


Well I remember yesterday
Just drifting slowly through a crowded street
With neon darkness shimmering through the haze
A sea of faces rippling in the heat

And from that nameless changing crowd
A sweet vibration seemed to fill the air
I stood astounded, staring hard
At men with flowers resting in their hair

A sweet confusion filled my mind
Until I woke up only finding 
Everything was just a dream
A dream unusual of its kind
That gave me peace and blew my mind
And now I'm hung up on a dream

They spoke with soft persuading words
About a living creed of gentle love
And turned me on to sounds unheard
And showed me strangest clouded sights above 

Which gently touched my aching mind
And soothed the wonderings of my troubled brain
Sometimes I think I'll never find
Such purity and peace of mind again


I knew her when summer was her crown
And autumn sad how brown her eyes

Now 
See her walk by
Peppermint coat
Button-down clothes
Buttoned up high
Diamonds and stones
Hang from her hand
Isn't she smart
Isn't she grand

I knew her when summer was her crown
And autumn sad how brown her eyes
I knew her when winter was her cloak
And spring her voice she spoke to me

Now
Silver and gold
Strawberry clothes
Money will buy
Something to hold
See in her eyes
Nothing will last
Like emerald stones
and platinum

I knew her when summer was her crown
And autumn sad how brown her eyes
I knew her when winter was her cloak
And spring her voice she spoke to me

I knew her when summer was her crown
And autumn sad how brown her eyes
I knew her when winter was her cloak
And spring her voice she spoke to me


I close my eyes and soon I'm feeling sleepy
I sleep so easy
There's nothing on my mind
And life seems kind now
I want her she wants me

I walk downtown and as I look around me
All around me
The people smile at me
It's plain to see that
I want her she wants me

She told me to be careful if I loved her (ooh)
'Cause she had given her heart once before

And now she knows she doesn't have to worry
I would not make her sorry
There's nothing on my mind
And life seems kind now
I want her she wants me

She told me to be careful if I loved her (ooh)
'Cause she had given her heart once before

And now she knows she doesn't have to worry
I would not make her sorry
There's nothing on my mind
And life seems kind now

I want her she wants me [repeats till fade out]


The warmth of your love's
Like the warmth from the sun
And this will be our year
Took a long time to come

Don't let go of my hand
Now darkness has gone
This will be our year
Took a long time to come

And I won't forget 
The way you helped me 
Up when I was down
And I won't forget
The way you said
Darling I love you
You gave me faith to go on
Now we're there 
And we've only just begun
This will be our year
Took a long time to come

The warmth of your smile
Smile for me little one
And this will be our year
Took a long time to come

You don't have to worry
All your worried days are gone
And this will be our year
Took a long time to come

And I won't forget 
The way you helped me 
Up when I was down
And I won't forget
The way you said
Darling I love you
You gave me faith to go on
Now we're there 
And we've only just begun
This will be our year
Took a long time to come

And this will be our year
Took a long time to come


A butcher, yes that was my trade
But the King's shilling is now my fee
A butcher I may as well have stayed
For the slaughter that I see

And the preacher in his pulpit
Sermoned "Go and fight, do what is right"
But he don't have to hear these guns
And I bet he sleeps at night

And I...
And I can't stop shaking
My hands won't stop shaking
My arms won't stop shaking
My mind won't stop shaking
I want to go home
Please let me go home
Go home

And I have seen a friend of mine
Hang on the wire like some rag toy
Then in the heat the flies come down
And cover up the boy

And the flies come down in Gommecourt,
Thiepval, Mametz Wood, and French Verdun
If the preacher, he could see those flies
Wouldn't preach for the sound of guns

And I...
And I can't stop shaking
My hands won't stop shaking
My arms won't stop shaking
My mind won't stop shaking
I want to go home
Please let me go home
Go home


When we're all in the crowd
And you catch her eye
And then you both smile
I feel so good inside

And when I'm with her
She talks about you
The things that you say
The things that you do

It feels so good to know two people
So in love, so in love

They are friends of mine (Joyce and Terry)
They are friends of mine (Paul and Molly)
And they've got something (Liz and Brian)
It's so hard to find (Joy and Davey)
They are friends of mine (Kim and Maggie)
They are friends of mine (June and Duffy)
And they've got something (Jean and Jim)
You don't often find (and Jim and Christie)

And she takes your hand
When the world stays outside
That's something to see
That's nothing to hide

And when I feel bad
When people disappoint me
That's when I need you two
To help me believe

It feels so good to know two people
So in love, so in love

They are friends of mine
They are friends of mine
And they've got something, it's so hard to find
They are friends of mine
They are friends of mine
And they've got something you don't often find

Joyce and Terry
Paul and Molly
Liz and Brian
Joy and Davey
Kim and Maggie
June and Duffy
Jean and Jim 
and Jim and Christie


It's the time of the season
When love runs high
In this time, give it to me easy
And let me try with pleasured hands

(To take you in the sun to) Promised lands
(To show you every one)
It's the time of the season for loving

What's your name? (What's your name?)
Who's your daddy? (Who's your daddy?)
