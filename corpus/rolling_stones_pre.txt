Well she drew out all her money out from southern trust
And put a little boy aboard a Greyhound bus
Leaving Louisiana for the golden west
Down came her tears from her happiness
Her own little son named Johnny B Goode
Was gonna make some motion pictures out in Hollywood

Now bye bye bye bye
Now bye bye bye bye
Bye bye Johnny, bye bye Johnny B Goode

Well, she remember taking money out from gathering crops
And buying Johnny's guitar at a broker shop
As long as he could play it by the railroad side
And wouldn't get in trouble she'd be satisfied
Never thought there'd ever come a day like this
When she would gladly give her son a goodbye kiss

Bye bye, bye bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye bye
Bye bye Johnny, bye bye Johnny B Goode

Well she finally got the letter she was dreaming of
Johnny wrote and told her he had fell in love
As soon as he was married he would bring her back
And build a mansion for her by the railroad tracks
And every time they heard the locomotive roar
They'd be a standing, waving in the kitchen door

Now bye bye bye bye
Now bye bye bye bye
Bye bye Johnny, bye bye Johnny B Goode

But who are you to tell her who to love?
That's up to her, yes, and the Lord above
You better move on

Well I know you can buy her fancy clothes and diamond rings
But I believe she's happy with me without those things
Still you beg me to set her free

But look out man she's crazy
She'll really do you in
If you let her get under your skin

Poison ivy, poison ivy
Well late at night when you're sleeping

Measles make you bumpy and mumps'll make you lumpy
And chicken pox'll make you jump and twitch
A common cold'll cool you but whooping cough'll fool you
But poison ivy's gonna make you itch

You're gonna need an ocean
Of calamine lotion
You'll be scratching like a hound
The minute you start to mess around

When your man is gone 

Oh, Carol
Don't let him steal your heart away
I'm gonna learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day

Climb into my machine so we can groove on out
I know some swinging little joint where we can jump and shout

It's not too far back on the highway not too long a ride
You park the car out in the open you can walk inside

A little cutie takes your hat and you can thank her ma'am
'Cause every time you make the scene you find the joint is jammed

Oh, Carol
Don't let him steal your heart away
I'm gonna learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day

Now, if you want to hear some music like the boys are playing
Hold tight, bang your foot don't let it carry you away

Don't let the heat overcome you when they play so loud
Won't the music intrigue you when they get a crowd

Well you can't dance I know you would you could
I got my eyes on you, baby, cause you dance so good

Oh, Carol
Don't let him steal your heart away
I'm gonna learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day

Oh, Carol
Don't let him steal your heart away
I've got to learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day

You gotta tell me you're coming back to me
You gotta tell me you're coming back to me
You gotta tell me you're coming back to me

Ah ah listen everybody (body)
Especially you girls (girl)
It's not right to be left alone
When the one you love is never home

I loved too hard my friends sometime say
But I believe, I believe
That a woman should be loved that way
But it hurts me so inside
To see you treat me so unkind
Somebody, somewhere tell her it's not fair

Can I get a witness (can I get a witness)
I want a witness (can I get a witness)
I want a witness (can I get a witness)
Somebody (can I get a witness)

Is it right to be treated so bad
When you give it everything you had
If I talks in my sleep
'Cause I haven't seen my baby all week
Now you chicks you all agree
This ain't the way it's supposed to be
Let me hear you
Let me hear you say, "Yeah yeah"

Up early in the morning
Well they're all in my mind
Just to find her out all night
Well I've been crying
But I believe
A women's a man's best friend
I'm gonna stick by her
Until the very end

Well she caused me so much misery
I forget how it's supposed to be
Somebody, somewhere
Tell her it ain't fair
Can I get a witness

Can I get a witness (can I get a witness)
I want a witness (can I get a witness)
Witness, witness (can I get a witness)
Witness, witness (can I get a witness)

Everybody knows
Especially you girls
That a love can be sad
But half a loves is twice as bad
Now you chicks you all agree
That ain't the way love's supposed to be
Let me hear you
Let me hear you say "Yeah yeah"

I want a witness (can I get a witness)
I want a witness (can I get a witness)
Yeah I want a witness (I want a witness)
Somebody (can I get a witness)

Let me hear

You wanna lay down and die
Yeah, yeah, you can make it if you try

If your baby treats you wrong
Don't run around being blue
Remember my friend
Everybody can't win
'Cause you know sometime, sometime
You got to lose
You can make it if you try

They always told me
I could make it if I tried
I'm gonna make it if I try
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna make it if I try
If you try

Those doors flew back

But they kept on rocking
Goin' round and round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking

With my heart in my hand
I put it to you mama
Hoping that you'll understand

Oh, baby
Mama, please don't dog me 'round
Yeah I, I would rather love you, baby
Than anyone else I know in town

This is my confession, Mama
And it's sung by all your song
It proves that I'm in heaven, Mama
When you hold me in your arms

Well, baby
Can I have you for myself
Yeah, if I can't have you, baby
I don't want nobody else

Well, baby
Don't you want a man like me
Well, baby

A empty heart is like a empty life
I said a empty heart is like a empty life
Well, it makes you feel like you wanna cry
Like you wanna cry

Time is on my side, yes it is
Time is on my side, yes it is

You'll come running back (I said so many times before)
You'll come running back to me

Oh, time is on my side, yes it is
Time is on my side, yes it is

You're searching for good times
But just wait and see

You'll come running back to me

Go ahead, go ahead and light up the town
And baby, do everything your heart desires

There've been bad times
I have my share of hard times, too
But I lost my faith in the world
Honey, when I lost you

Remember the good times we've had together?
Don't you want them back again?
Though these hard times are bugging me now
Honey, now it's a sin

There's gotta be trust in this world
Or it won't get very far
Well, trust in someone
Or there's gonna be war

Well, baby used to stay out all night long
She made me cry, she done me wrong
She hurt my eyes open, that's no lie
Tables turn and now her turn to cry

Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now

Well, she used to run around with every man in town
She spent all my money, playing her high class game
She put me out, it was a pity how I cried
Tables turn and now her turn to cry

Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now

Well, I used to wake in the morning, get my breakfast in bed
When I'd gotten worried she'd ease my aching head
But now she's here and there, with every man in town
Still trying to take me for that same old clown

Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now

Because I used to love her, but it's all over now

When the sun beats down
And burns the tar up on the roof
And your shoes get so hot
You wish your tired feet were fireproof
Under the boardwalk
Down by the sea
On a blanket with my baby
That's where I'll be

(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be having some fun
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above
(Under the boardwalk) We were falling in love
(Under the boardwalk, boardwalk)

On the park you'll hear
The happy sound of a carousel
You can almost taste the hot dogs
And french fries they sell
Under the boardwalk
Down by the sea, yeah
On a blanket with my baby
That's where I'll be

(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be having some fun
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above
(Under the boardwalk) We were falling in love
(Under the boardwalk, boardwalk)

Oh, under the boardwalk
Down by the sea
On a blanket with my baby
That's where I'll be

(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be having some fun
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above
(Under the boardwalk) We were falling in love
(Under the boardwalk, boardwalk)

You gotta need too
To see you through

Lord I swear the perfume you wear
Was made out of turnip greens
And everytime I kiss you girl
It tastes like pork and beans

Even though you're wearin' them
Citified high heels
I can tell by your giant step
You been walkin' through the cotton fields

Oh, you're so down home girl

Everytime you monkey child
You take my breath away
And everytime you move like that
I gotta get down and pray

Don't you know that dress of yours
Was made out of fiberglass?
And everytime you move like that
I gotta go to Sunday mass

Oh, you're so down home girl

Oh, you're so down home girl

I'm gonna take you to the muddy river
And push you in
Just to watch the water roll on
Down your velvet skin

I'm gonna take you back to New Orleans
Down in Dixieland
I'm gonna watch you do the second line
With an umbrella in your hand

Oh, you're so down home girl

I'm with you baby
You're so down home
Ow! Yeah, too much
Outta sight
You're so down home girl

I bought a brand new airmobile
It was custom made it was a Flight DeVille
With a powerful motor and some hideaway wings
Push in on the button and you can hear her sing

Now you can't catch me
No, baby, you can't catch me
Cause if you get too close
You know I'm gone like a cool breeze

New Jersey Turnpike in the wee wee hours
I was rolling slowly 'cause of drizzlin' showers
Up come a flattop he was movin' up with me
Then come sailin' goodbye in a little old souped-up mini

I put my foot in my tank and I begin to roll
Moanin' sirens, was the state patrol
So I get out my wings and then I blew my horn
Bye-bye New Jersey I become airborne

Now you can't catch me
No, baby you can't catch me
'Cause if you get too close
You know I'm gone like a cool breeze

Flyin' with my baby last Saturday night
Wasn't no gray cloud floatin' in sight
Big full moon shinin' up above
Cuddle up honey be my love

Sweetest little thing that I ever seen
I'm gonna name you Mabelline
Flyin' with all the things set on flight control
Radio tuned to rock 'n' roll

Two, three hours passin' by
Altitude dropped to 505
Fuel consumption way too fast
Let's get on home before we run out of gas

Now you can't catch me
No baby, you can't catch me
Cause if you get too close
You know I'm gone like a cool breeze

There've been so many girls that I've known
I've made so many cry
And still I wonder why
Here comes the little girl
I see her walking down the street
She's all by herself
I try and knock her off her feet

But, she'll never break, never break, never break, never break
This heart of stone
Oh, no, no, this heart of stone
What's different about her? I don't really know
No matter how I try I just can't make her cry

Cause she'll never break, never break, never break, never break
This heart of stone
Oh, no, no, no, this heart of stone

Don't keep on looking that same old way
If you try acting sad
You'll only make me glad
Better listen little girl
You go on walking down the street
I ain't got no love, I ain't the kind to meet

'Cause she'll never break, never break, never break, never break
This heart of stone
Oh, no, no, you'll never break this heart of stone darling
No, no, this heart of stone
You'll never break it darling
You won't break this heart of stone
Oh no no no
You better go
You better go home
Cause you'll, you'll never break this heart of stone
You better
You better drive on home

What a shame
Nothing seems to be going right
What a shame
Nothing seems to be going right
It seems easy to me that everything can be alright

What a shame
They always wanna start a fight
What a shame
They always wanna start a fight
Well it scares me so I could sleep in the shelter all night

Well alright

What a shame
You all heard what I said
What a shame
Y'all heard what I said
You might wake up in the morning and find your poor self dead

Now, if you wanna hear some boogie like I'm gonna play
It's just an old piano and a knockout bass
The drummer's man's a cat, they call Charlie McCoy
You know, remember that rubber legged boy?
Mama, cookin' chicken fried and bacon grease
Come on along boys, it's just down the road apiece

Well there's a place you really get your kicks
It's open every night about twelve to six
Now if you wanna hear some boogie you can get your fill
And shove and sting like an old steam drill
Come on along you can lose your lead
Down the road, down the road, down the road apiece

Well there's a place you really get your kicks
It's open every night about twelve to six
Now if you wanna hear some boogie you can get your fill
And shove and sting like an old steam drill
Come on along, you can lose your lead
Down the road, down the road, down the road apiece

Sittin' in my bedroom late last night
Got into bed and turned out the light
Decided to call my baby on the telephone
All I got was an engaged tone

It's off the hook
It's off the hook
It's off the hook
It's off the hook
It's off the hook

Talkin' so long she upset my mind
Why is she talkin' such a long time?
Maybe she's sleeping, maybe she's ill
Phone's disconnected, unpaid bill

It's off the hook
It's off the hook
It's off the hook
It's off the hook
It's off the hook

Don't wanna see her, afraid of what I'd find
Tired of letting her upset me all the time
Back into bed started reading my books
Take my phone right off of the hook

It's off the hook
It's off the hook
It's off the hook
It's off the hook
It's off the hook
It's off the hook
[Repeat and fade]

Pain in my heart
Treatin' me poor
Where can my baby be?
Lord, no one knows
Pain in my heart
Won't let me sleep
Where can my baby be
Lord, where is she?

And one day
My days are gettin' tough
Won't you come back, come back, come back, baby
Lord

Pain in my heart
Won't let me be
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I wake up restless night in misery
Lord

Won't somebody stop this pain

Lord, one day
My days are gettin' tough
Won't you love me, love me, love me, baby

Pain in my heart
Pain in my heart
Somebody stop this
Pain in my heart
It's killin' me baby
This pain in my heart
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Pain in my heart
This pain in my heart

No matter how much she wants me
I'm not going nowhere
I'm gonna stick right here, babe
You know how much I care

So don't worry 'bout me baby
'Cause I'm right here at home
Oh baby, oh baby, we got a good thing goin'

You may talk all about me
And scandalize my name
But deep down inside of me
I know I'm the only man

So don't worry 'bout me baby
'Cause I'm right here at home
Oh baby, oh baby, we got a good thing goin'

So maybe I knew her
Once upon a time
But that's all in the past babe
Baby let me know you're mine, all mine, all mine

No matter how much she wants me
I'm not going nowhere
I'm gonna stick right here, babe
I know how much you care

So don't worry 'bout me baby
'Cause I'm right here at home
Oh baby, oh baby, we got a good thing goin'

Got a good thing goin' baby
We got a good thing goin'
That's what I said
We got a good thing goin'
Got a thing goin' for ourselves
Got a thing goin' for ourselves
We got a pretty good thing goin'

I am the little red rooster
Too lazy to crow for day
I am the little red rooster
Too lazy to crow for day

Keep everything in the farm yard upset in every way

The dogs begin to bark and hounds begin to howl
Dogs begin to bark and hounds begin to howl
Watch out strange cat people
Little red rooster's on the prowl

If you see my little red rooster
Please drive him home
If you see my little red rooster
Please drive him home

Ain't had no peace in the farm yard
Since my little red rooster's been gone

Heard from friends of mine
You been telling lies
How I was wrapped up in you

But surprise, surprise
Surprise, surprise
I never wanted you that bad
'Cause I knew you was telling lies
Knew you was telling lies
I could see it in your eyes

Why did you have to
Go and fool after
We had got along so fine?

But surprise, surprise
Surprise, surprise
Ain't nothing strange to me
Knew you was telling lies
Knew you was telling lies
I could see it in your eyes

Knew you was telling lies
Knew you was telling lies
I could see it in your eyes

I hope you're proud of
All your chasin' 'round
Thinkin' I was alone all night

But surprise, surprise
Surprise, surprise
You're only foolin' yourself
'Cause I knew you was telling lies
Knew you was telling lies
I could see it in your eyes

Yeah, baby why did you have to go fool around
After we got along so fine
I knew you was tellin' lies and tellin' jive
Yes I did
We got along so fine

But I knew you was telling lies
Knew you was talkin' jive
I could see it in your eyes

Have mercy, have mercy, baby
Have mercy, have mercy on me

Well I went to see the gypsy
To have my fortune read
She said "Man, your baby gonna leave you
Her bags are packed up under the bed,"

That's right

Have mercy, have mercy, baby
Have mercy, have mercy on me

But if you leave me baby
Girl if you put me down
I'm gonna make it to the nearest river child
And jump overboard and drown

That's right

Have mercy, have mercy, baby
Have mercy, have mercy on me

I said hey hey baby, hey hey now
What you trying to do
Hey hey baby, hey hey now
Please don't say we're through

Have mercy, have mercy, baby
Have mercy, have mercy on me

But if you stay baby
I tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna work two jobs, seven days a week
And bring my money home to you

That's right

Have mercy, please, have mercy, baby
Have mercy, have mercy on me
Yeah
Have mercy, have mercy, baby
Have mercy, have mercy on me

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm drivin' in my car
And the man comes on the radio
He's tellin' me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination

I can't get no
Oh no no no
Hey hey hey
That's what I say

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm watchin' my TV
And a man comes on and tells me
How white my shirts can be
But he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me

I can't get no
Oh no no no
Hey hey hey
That's what I say

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no girl reaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm ridin' round the world
And I'm doin' this and I'm signin' that
And I'm tryin' to make some girl
Who tells me baby better come back maybe next week
Can't you see I'm on a losing streak

I can't get no
Oh no no no
Hey hey hey
That's what I say

I can't get no, I can't get no
I can't get no satisfaction
No satisfaction, no satisfaction
No satisfaction, I can't get no

When your baby leaves you all alone
And nobody call you on the phone

Don't you feel like crying?
Don't you feel like crying like crying like crying?
Come on baby, cry to me

When you're all alone in your lonely room
And there's nothing but the smell of her perfume

Don't you feel like crying?
Don't you feel like crying like crying like crying?
Come on baby, (come on) cry to me

Nothing could be sadder than a glass of wine alone
Loneliness loneliness, it just a waste of your time
But you don't ever you don't ever have to walk alone
You see, so come on take my hand
Come on walk with me

When you're waiting for a voice to come
In the night and there is no one

Don't you feel like crying?
Don't you feel like crying like crying like crying?
Come on baby, cry to me
Come on baby, that's right cry to me
Yes, I want you to come on baby

Well I'm waiting at the bus stop in downtown L.A.
Well I'm waiting at the bus stop in downtown L.A.
But I'd much rather be on a boardwalk on Broadway

Well I'm sitting here thinkin' just how sharp I am
Well I'm sitting here thinkin' just how sharp I am
I'm an under assistant west coast promo man, yeah, yeah

Well I promo groups when they come into town
Well I promo groups when they come into town
Well they laugh at my toupee, they're sure to put me down

Well I'm sitting here thinking just how sharp I am
Yeah I'm sitting here thinking just how sharp I am
I'm a necessary talent behind every rock and roll band

Yeah, I'm sharp, I'm really, really sharp
I sure do earn my pay, sitting on the beach every day
Yeah, I'm real real sharp, yes I am
I got a Corvette and a seersucker suit, yes I have

Here comes the bus, uh oh
I though I had a dime, where's my dime
I know I have a dime somewhere
I'm pretty sure

Well, you've got your diamonds and you've got your pretty clothes
And the chauffeur drives your cars
You let everybody know

But don't play with me, cause you're playing with fire

Your mother she's an heiress, owns a block in Saint John's Wood
And your father'd be there with her
If he only could

But don't play with me, cause you're playing with fire

Your old man took her diamonds and tiaras by the score
Now she gets her kicks in Stepney
Not in Knightsbridge anymore

So don't play with me, cause you're playing with fire

Now you've got some diamonds and you will have some others
But you'd better watch your step, girl
Or start living with your mother

So don't play with me, cause you're playing with fire
So don't play with me, cause you're playing with fire

Sittin' thinkin' sinkin' drinking
Wondering what I'd do when I'm through tonight
Smoking moping, maybe just hoping
Some little girl will pass on by

Don't wanna be alone but I love my girl at home
I remember what she said

She said, "My, my, my don't tell lies, keep fidelity in your head
My my my, don't tell lies. When you're done you should go to bed
Don't say hi, like a spider to a fly
Jump right ahead and you're dead"

Sit up, fed up, low down go round
Down to the bar at the place I'm at
Sitting drinking, superficially thinking
About the rinsed-out blonde on my left

Then I said, "Hi" like a spider to a fly
Remembering what my little girl said

She was common, flirty, she looked about thirty
I would have run away but I was on my own
She told me later she's a machine operator
She said she liked the way I held the microphone

I said my, my, like a spider to a fly
Jump right ahead in my web

You need some money in a hurry
But things ain't right
You try to beg and borrow maybe start a fight
Your friends don't wanna know you they just pass you by
So they couldn't be your friends because they wouldn't lie

Sit down shut up don't dare to cry
Things will get better if you really try
So don't you panic don't you panic
Give it one more try
Don't you panic don't you panic
Give it one more try

You got a girl that doesn't bring you all she cries
The day turns into night to try to satisfy
You bring her all the things she want she don't improve
You think you'd give her up if you could make that move

So, sit down shut up don't dare to cry
Things will get better if you really try
So don't you panic don't you panic
Give it one more try
Don't you panic don't you panic
Give it one more try try

The things that don't matter easy come and go
And the things that satisfy only come real slow
You gotta know and watch it all in your mind
'Cause it's better when you get it if you really try

So, sit down shut up don't dare to cry
Things will get better if you really try
So don't you panic don't you panic
Give it one more try
Don't you panic don't you panic
Give it one more try

Keep on trying
Keep on trying
Keep on trying
Keep on trying
Keep on trying
You gotta keep trying

Dam deedle dee dam dam
Little girl, where did you come from?
Try a little bit to make my mouth dribble
Come on baby, let's ride away in the rain

Baby you drive me crazy
Drive my poor heart hazy
Just a little bit
A little while with you
Come on baby, let's ride away in the rain

She said yeah, dam deedle dee dam dam

Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
I met her walking down an uptown street
She's so fine I wish she was mine
I get shook up every time we meet

Talkin' 'bout you (nobody but you, baby)
Nobody but you (yes you all the time)
I do mean you (yeah my baby)

Just trying to get a message to you

Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
Help me know she looks so good
Lovely skin, well she's soaked in gin
She oughta be somewhere in Hollywood

Talkin' 'bout you (I'm talkin' 'bout my baby)
Nobody but you (yes she's alright)
I do mean you (yeah my baby)

Just trying to get a message to you

Talkin' 'bout you (nobody but you baby)
Nobody but you (yes you all the time)
I do mean you (yeah yeah)

Just trying to get a message to you

Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
Sitting right here by my side
Lovely indeed that why I ask if she
Promise someday she will be my bride

Talkin' 'bout you (yeah talk)
Nobody but you (yes my my baby)
I do mean you (yeah yeah)

I'm just trying to get a message through

Talkin' 'bout my baby too much

Yeah yeah yeah
Talkin' 'bout my baby

Now look what you've done
Now look what you've done
Look what you've done baby
Now look what you've done
You left me here
The lonely one
And all I can say
Is look what you've done

A broken heart
A worried mind
Because of you baby
Dying all the time
I once had a dream
But now I've none
You're taking your love
And see what it done

I saw you last night
Out moving round
With your new turf
You paint the town
That is OK
You're having your fun
Because some day
They call you done

And now your bird cries
The shadow falls
Gloomy memories
And I recall
Your love is my life
As warm as the sun
But now it is gone
And see what it done

Everywhere you want I always go
I always give in because, babe, you know
You just say so
'Cause you give me that feeling inside
That I know I must be right
It's the singer not the song

It's not the way you give in willingly
Others do it without thrilling me
Giving me that same old feeling inside
That I know I must be right
It's the singer not the song

The same old places and the same old songs
We've been going there for much too long
There's something wrong
And it gives me that feeling inside
That I know I must be right
It's the singer not the song
It's the singer not the song
It's the singer not the song

I live on an apartment on the ninety-ninth floor of my block
And I sit at home looking out the window
Imagining the world has stopped
Then in flies a guy who's all dressed up just like a Union Jack
And says, "I've won five pounds if I have his kind of detergent pack"

I said, "Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd
On my cloud, baby"

The telephone is ringing
I say, "Hi, it's me, who is it there on the line?"
A voice says, "Hi, hello, how are you?"
"Well, I guess I'm doin' fine"
He says, "It's three A.M., there's too much noise
Don't you people ever wanna go to bed?
Because you feel so good
Do you have to drive me out of my head?"

I said, "Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd
On my cloud, baby"

I was sick and tired, fed up with this
And decided to take a drive downtown
It was so very quiet and peaceful
There was nobody, not a soul around
I laid myself out, I was so tired
And I started to dream
In the morning the parking tickets were just like flags
Stuck on my windscreen

I said, "Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd
On my cloud"

Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Don't hang around baby two's a crowd
On my cloud

Hey, you

I'm free to do what I want any old time
I'm free to do what I want any old time
So love me, hold me, love me, hold me
Cause I'm free any old time to get what I want

I'm free to sing my song though it gets out of time
I'm free to sing my song though it gets out of time
So love me, hold me, love me, hold me
Cause I'm free any old time to get what I want

Yeah

Love me, hold me, love me, hold me
Cause I'm free any old time to get what I want

I'm free to choose whom I please any old time
I'm free to please whom I choose any old time
So hold me, love me, love me, hold me
Cause I'm free any old time to get what I want, yes I am

It is the evening of the day
I sit and watch the children play
Smiling faces I can see
But not for me
I sit and watch
As tears go by

My riches can't buy everything
I want to hear the children sing
All I hear is the sound
Of rain falling on the ground
I sit and watch
As tears go by

It is the evening of the day
I sit and watch the children play
Doin' things I used to do
They think are new
I sit and watch
As tears go by

Baby, the truth is out so don't deny
Baby to think I believed all your lies
Darlin' I can't stand to see your face
It's the truth, you understand

I got to get away, got to get away
Gotta, gotta, gotta get away
Got to get away

Baby, I don't want to live here no more
Baby, though I tore your pictures off my walls
Darlin' this old room's falling in on me
You understand the truth now

I got to get away, got to get away
Gotta, gotta, gotta get away
Got to get away

Baby, oh, how could you take away your clothes
Baby, don't screw up this old heart of gold
Darling, this will rule my social flare
You understand me now

I got to get away, got to get away
Gotta, gotta, gotta get away
Got to get away

So now that she is gone
You won't be sad for long
For maybe just an hour or just a moment
Of the day

Then blue turns to grey
And try as you may
You just don't feel good
You don't feel alright
And you know that you must find her, find her, find her

You think you'll have a ball
And you won't care at all
You'll find another girl or maybe more
To pass the time away

Then blue turns to grey
And try as you may
You just don't feel good
You just don't feel alright
And you know that you must find her, find her, find her

She's not home when you call
So you can go to all
The places where she used to go
But she has gone away

Then blue turns to grey
And try as you may
You just don't feel good
You don't feel alright
And you know that you must find her, find her, find her

Blue turns to grey (blue turns to grey)
She has gone away (blue turns to grey)
I feel so bad (blue turns to grey)
I wish you'd come on home (blue turns to grey)
I feel, I feel so down

I warned you baby from time to time
You don't listen so pay me no mind
About movin' on
Yeah I'm a moving on
I'm through with you
Too bad you're blue
I'll move on

Mister Engineer with your throttle in hand
Take me back to that Southern land
It called moving
Keep a rolling on
You're flying too high
For my old sky
I'll move on

Mister Fireman please won't you listen to me
I got a woman in Tennessee
Keep on moving
Keep a rolling on
You're flying too high
It's all over now
I move on

Yes I'm gonna move
I'm gonna move
Said I'm gonna move
Gotta go home
I gotta go home
I gotta go home
Well tell ya

I I I I'm going home
I I I I'm going home
I I I I'm going home
I've gotta go home

I've gotta go baby
I gotta keep rolling
And I'm gonna move
I said I'm gonna move baby
I said going going home
I'm going home darling

I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by, dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by, dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

Hmm, hmm, hmm...

I wanna see it painted, painted black
Black as night, black as coal
I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black

Yeah!

Hmm, hmm, hmm...


I'm not talking about the kind of clothes she wears
Look at that stupid girl
I'm not talking about the way she combs her hair
Look at that stupid girl

The way she powders her nose
Her vanity shows and it shows
She's the worst thing in this world
Well, look at that stupid girl

I'm not talking about the way she digs for gold
Look at that stupid girl
Well, I'm talking about the way she grabs and holds
Look at that stupid girl

The way she talks about someone else
That she don't even know herself
She's the sickest thing in this world
Well, look at that stupid girl

Well, I'm sick and tired
And I really have my doubts
I've tried and tried
But it never really works out

Like a lady-in-waiting to a virgin queen
Look at that stupid girl
She bitches 'bout things that she's never seen
Look at that stupid girl

It doesn't matter if she dyes her hair
Or the color of the shoes she wears
She's the worst thing in this world
Well, look at that stupid girl

Shut-up, shut-up, shut-up, shut-up, shut-up
Shut-up, shut-up, shut-up, shut-up, shut-up
Shut-up, shut-up, shut-up

Like a lady-in-waiting to a virgin queen
Look at that stupid girl
She bitches 'bout things that she's never seen
Look at that stupid girl

She purrs like a pussycat
Then she turns 'round and hisses back
She's the sickest thing in this world
Look at that stupid girl

My sweet Lady Jane
When I see you again
Your servant am I
And will humbly remain

Just heed this plea my love
On bended knees my love
I pledge myself to Lady Jane

My dear Lady Anne
I've done what I can
I must take my leave
For promised I am

This play is run my love
Your time has come my love
I pledge my troth to Lady Jane

Oh my sweet Marie
I wait at your eaves
The sands have run out
For your lady and me

Wedlock is nigh my love
Her station's right my love
Life is secure with Lady Jane


Under my thumb
The girl who once had me down
Under my thumb
The girl who once pushed me around

It's down to me
The difference in the clothes she wears
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb

And ain't it the truth babe?

Under my thumb
It's a squirmin' dog who's just had her day
Under my thumb
A girl who has just changed her ways

It's down to me, yes it is
The way she does just what she's told down to me
The change has come
She's under my thumb
Ah, ah, say it's alright

Under my thumb
A Siamese cat of a girl
Under my thumb
She's the sweetest, hmmm, pet in the world

It's down to me
The way she talks when she's spoken to
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb
Ah, take it easy babe
Yeah

It's down to me, oh yeah
The way she talks when she's spoken to
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb
Yeah, it feels alright

Under my thumb
Her eyes are just kept to herself
Under my thumb, well I
I can still look at someone else

It's down to me, oh that's what I said
The way she talks when she's spoken to
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb
Say, it's alright

Say it's all
Say it's all

Take it easy babe
Take it easy babe
Feels alright
Take it, take it easy babe

I said, "Oh no, don't you follow me no more."
I said, "Oh no, don't you follow me no more."
Well I'm looking for my face
And I got no place to go

I said, "Oh no, don't you follow me no more."
I said, "Oh no, don't you follow me no more."
Well, pick your own mind
And don't you touch mine no more

Still waiting here for a single idea
In your clothes and your hair
I wore it last year
Oh no, don't you follow me no more

I said, "Oh no, don't you copy me no more."
I said, "Oh no, don't you copy me no more."
Well, the lines around my eyes
Are protected by a copyright law

Well, all the clubs and the bars
And the little red cars
Not knowing why, but trying to get high
Oh no, don't you follow me no more

Don't you follow
Don't you follow

I'm givin' you a piece of my mind
There no charge of any kind
Try a very simple test
You should just retrace your steps

And think back, back a little bit baby
Back, back alright

Think, think, think back baby
Think, think back a bit girl
Think, think, think back baby
Tell me whose fault was that, babe?
Tell me whose fault was that, babe?

Think about a year ago
How we lived I'll never know
Connin' people for a dime
Here's another piece of my mind

And think back, back a little bit baby
Back, back alright

Think, think, think back baby
Think, think back a bit girl
Think, think, think back baby
Tell me whose fault was that, babe?
Tell me whose fault was that, babe?

Take a look inside yourself
You're not really someone else
Still, I am the same old me
You say I lack maturity

But think back, back a little bit baby
Back, back, alright!

We're not children anymore
We don't need to play with toys
Take a look and you will find
You're gettin' old before your time

But think back, back a little bit baby
Back, back alright

Think, think, think back baby
Think, think I said back a bit girl
Think, think, think back baby
Tell me whose fault was that, babe?
Tell me whose fault was that, babe?

I said think
You'd better think back a little bit
I said think
What about last year and the year before?
I said think
You promised me so much
I said think
Don't you 'member what you said?

High and dry well, I'm up here with no warning
High and dry well, I couldn't get a word in

High and dry oh, what a way to go
She left me standing here just high and dry

A minute I was up there standing by her side
The next I was down there, well, left out of the ride and

High and dry oh, what a way to go
She left me standing here just high and dry

Anythin' I wished for I only had to ask her (yep)
I think she found out it was money I was after

High and dry oh, what a weird letdown
She left me standing here just high and dry

Alright

Well, it's lucky that I didn't have any love towards her
Next time I'll make sure that the girl'll be much poorer

High and dry oh, what a way to go
She left me standing here just high and dry

High and dry well, I'm up here with no warning
Yep
High and dry well, I couldn't get a word in

High and dry oh, what a way to go
She left me standin' here just high and dry
Well, she left me standin' here just high and dry
Well, she left me standin' here just high and dry
Hey!

It's not easy
It's not easy living on your own
It's not easy
It's not easy living on your own

And it's hard (it's not easy)
And it's hard (it's not easy)
And it's a pretty hard babe (it's not easy)
It's not easy living on your own

All of the things that you used to do
If they're done now, well they're done by you
It seems a big failing in a man
To take his girl for granted if he can

And it's hard baby (it's not easy)
And it's hard (it's not easy)
And it's a pretty hard babe (it's not easy)
It's not easy livin' on your own

There's no place where you can call home
Got me running like a cat in a thunderstorm
Just a big bed and a telephone
Like the last remnants of a stately home

And it's a pretty hard baby (it's not easy)
And it's hard (it's not easy)
Well, it's a pretty hard baby (it's not easy)
It's not easy livin' on your own

And it's a hard (it's not easy)
And it's a hard (it's not easy)
And it's a pretty hard babe (it's not easy)
It's not easy living on your own

Sit here thinking with your head of fire
Go think the same thing and never tire
Imaginin' the glow of her long clean hair
As she goes to sit on her own high chair

And it's a hard babe (it's not easy)
Well, it's a pretty hard babe (it's not easy)
Well, it's hard babe (it's not easy)
It's not easy livin' on your own

It's not easy (a pretty tough babe)
It's not easy (well, life's pretty rough)
It's not easy (it's a hard time baby)
It's not easy (it's a hard time baby)
It's not easy (it's a pretty hard life)

I am waiting, I am waiting
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I am waiting, I am waiting

Fears will pierce your bones

Waiting for someone to come out of somewhere
Waiting for someone to come out of somewhere

Home, bome, bome, bome, back home

Who wants yesterday's papers
Who wants yesterday's girl?
Who wants yesterday's papers?
Nobody in the world

Well, after this time I finally learned
After the pain and hurt
After all this what have I achieved
I've realized it's time to leave

Cause
Who wants yesterday's papers?
Who wants yesterday's girl?
Who wants yesterday's papers?
Nobody in the world

I'm living a life of constant change
Every day means the turn of a page
Yesterday's papers are such bad news
Same thing applies to me and you

Who wants yesterday's papers?
Who wants yesterday's girl?
Who wants yesterday's papers?
Nobody in the world

It seems very hard to have just one girl
When there's a million in the world
All of these people just can't wait
To fall right into their big mistake

'Cause who wants yesterday's papers?
Who wants yesterday's girl?
Who wants yesterday's papers?
Nobody in the world

She would never say where she came from
Yesterday don't matter if it's gone
While the sun is bright
Or in the darkest night
No one knows
She comes and goes

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

Don't question why she needs to be so free
She'll tell you it's the only way to be
She just can't be chained
To a life where nothing's gained
And nothing's lost
At such a cost

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

"There's no time to lose," I heard her say
"Catch your dreams before they slip away
Dying all the time
Lose your dreams
And you will lose your mind
Ain't life unkind?"

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

All I want to do is to get back to you

Connection, I just can't make no connection
But all I want to do is to get back to you

Everything is going in the wrong direction
The doctor wants to give me more injections
Giving me shots for a thousand rare infections
And I don't know if he'll let me go

Connection, I just can't make no connection
But all I want to do is to get back to you
Connection, I just can't make it, connection
All I want to do is to get back to you

My bags they get a very close inspection
I wonder why it is that they suspect 'em
They're dying to add me to their collection
And I don't know if they'll let me go

Connection, I just can't make no connection
But all I want to do is to get back to you
Connection, I just can't make no connection
And all I want to do is to get back to you

Connection, I just can't make no connection
And all I want to do is to get back to you

Why do my thoughts loom so large on me?
They seem to stay, for day after day
And won't disappear, I've tried every way

But she smiled sweetly
She smiled sweetly
She smiled sweetly
And says don't worry
Oh, no no no

Where does she hide it inside of her?
That keeps her peace most every day
And won't disappear, my hair's turning grey

But she smiled sweetly
She smiled sweetly
She smiled sweetly
And says don't worry

"There's nothing in why or when
There's no use trying, you're here
Begin again, and o'er again"

That's what she said so softly
I understood for once in my life
And feeling good most all of the time

'Cause she smiled sweetly
She smiled sweetly
She smiled sweetly
And said don't worry
Oh, no no no
Oh, no no no
Oh, no no no


Well she's very wealthy it's true
So in that, she is one up on you
She's dressed all in red, white and blue
And she always knows more than you do

She's so affected
Cool, calm, collected

She knows who to smile to today
She has just been brought up in that way
She knows all the right games to play
And she always just knows what to say

She's well-respected
Cool, calm, collected

She's so affected
Cool, calm, collected

In public the strain's hard to bear
She exudes such a confident air
But behind she is not without care
But she sweeps it right under her hair

She's well-respected
Cool, calm, collected

She seems to glow brilliantly white
And her hair seems to shine in the night
With her feet unbelievably light
And her teeth ready, sharpened to bite

She's so respected
Cool, calm, collected

Why put this sadness inside of me?
Why be so matter-of-fact?
Why put this one bit of hope in me?
You sold me out and that's that

I hope that you're having fun with me
There's not much left to attack
I hope that you're nearly done with me
You sold me out and that's that

All sold out I'd never seen
A mind so tangled, a girl so strangled
All sold out well I felt so green
It was just like that
I was put down flat
I was sold out just like that

Oh baby
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, that's that

All sold out I'd never seen
A mind so tangled, a girl so strangled
All sold out well I felt so green
It was just like that
I was put down flat
I was sold out just like that

I missed the point of you doing it
Your mind has just jumped the track
I took a bit different view of it
You sold me out and that's that

Oh baby
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, that's that

My obsessions are your possessions
Every piece that I can get
My obsessions are your possessions
'Til my mouth is soaking wet
I think I blew it now, confession

You can't dodge it, it's simple logic
You'd be better off with me
And you'll know it when you lost it
Know it

My obsessions are your possessions
Are you smiling on my way
My obsessions are your possessions
One that you should give away
Give it to me now I've no objection

I don't mind if it's unkind
And it's not my property
But I want it just to be mine
Exclusively

Ooh baby, ooh baby
Ooh baby, ooh baby
Ooh baby, ooh baby
Ooh baby, ooh baby, aah

You need teaching, you're a girl
There are things in this world
That need teaching with discretion
My profession

My obsessions are your possessions
Are you used to the idea?
My obsessions are your possessions
Do you feel at home right here?
You should relax, it's my impression

Didn't see you were so young
I could almost be your son
Please turn in my direction
No objection

What you say girl? You see what is wrong
You, must be joking, you was led along

But the butler the baker, the laughing cavalier
Will tell me now, who's been sleeping here
I want to know
Tell me baby, who's been sleeping

What you say girl? Who'd you see that night
I I was doing, doing something right

Oh the soldier, the sailor then there's the three musketeers
Yes, they'll tell me now, who's been sleeping here

Did I ever tell you I want to know
Hey baby, who's been sleeping here

Don't you look like, like a Goldilocks
There must be somewhere, somewhere you can stop

Yes there's the noseless old newsboy the old British brigadier
But he'll tell me now, who's been sleeping here

Who's been eating, eating off my plate
Who will tell me, who'll investigate

There's the sergeants the soldiers the cruel old grenadier
But they'll tell me, now, who's been sleeping here

Cause I want to know who's been sleeping right here
Was it your mummy? Your daddy? Who's been sleeping here?
Was it your auntie? Your uncle? Who's been sleeping here?
Was it your boyfriend? Your girlfriend? Who's been sleeping here?
All right

Who's been sleeping here?

She looks so simple in her way
Does the same thing everyday
But she's dedicated
To having her own way
She's very complicated

Yeah

Women seem to fill her mind
And many men in so short time
But she's underrated
She treats me oh so kind
She's very complicated

Yeah

We talk together and discuss
What is really best for us
She's sophisticated
My head's fit to bust
'Cause she's so complicated

Break!
Yeah

She knows just how to please her man
She's softer than a baby lamb
But she's educated
Doesn't give a damn
She's very complicated

Break!
Na na na na na
Yeah!

She looks so simple in her way
Does the same thing everyday
But she's dedicated
To having her own way
She's very complicated
Break!

Break!
Na na come on, baby!
Na na na na na
Na na na na, yeah
A-come on, baby
Uh! Come on, babe

Down and down she goes, our Amanda Jones
I said down and down and down and down
She'd look really lovely at home
'Til somebody gonna come up and ask her
To live happily ever after, Miss Amanda Jones

On and on she goes, little Miss Amanda Jones
I said on and on and on and on
Just watch her as she grow
Don't wanna say it very obviously
But she's losing her nobility, Miss Amanda Jones

Hey girl, don't you realize
The money invested in you?
Hey girl, you just got to find
Someone who'll really pull your family through

Up and up she goes, our Amanda Jones
I said up and up and up and up
She looks quite delightfully stoned
She's the darling of the discotheque crowd
Of her lineage, she's rightfully proud, Miss Amanda Jones

Hey girl, with your nonsense nose
All pointing right down at the floor
Hey girl, your suspender shows
And the girl behind you looks a bit unsure

Round and round she goes, the world of Amanda Jones
I said round and round and round and round
The balls and the dinners and show
The little girl, she just wanders about
'Til it's time for her coming out, Miss Amanda Jones

Round and round and round
Round and round and round
Round and round and round
Round and round and round
Round and round and round
Round and round and round

Something happened to me yesterday
Something, I can't speak of right away
Something happened to me, something, oh, so groovy
Something happened to me yesterday

He don't know if it's right or wrong
Maybe he should tell someone
He's not sure just what it was
Or if it's against the law, something

Something very strange I hear you say
You're talking in a most peculiar way
But something really threw me, something, oh, so groovy
Something happened to me yesterday
(Yesterday)

He don't know just where it's gone
He don't really care at all
No one's sure just what it was
Or the meaning and the cause, something

What kinda joint is this?
Take your partners

He don't know if it's right or wrong
Maybe he should tell someone
He's not sure just what it was
Or if it's against the law, something

Someone says there's something more to pay
For sins that you committed yesterday
It's really rather drippy but something, oh, so trippy
Something happened to me yesterday

Right, he don't know just where it's gone
He don't really care at all
No one's sure just what it was
Or the meaning and the cause, something

Someone's singing loud across the bay
Sittin' on a mat about to pray
Isn't half as loony as something, oh, so groovy
Something happened to me yesterday

Right, he don't know if it's right or wrong
Maybe he should tell someone
He's not sure just what it was
Or if it's against the law, something

Well, thank you very much and now I think it's time for us all to go
So from all of us to all of you not forgetting the boys in the band
And our producer, Reg Thorpe, we'd like to say "God Bless"
So, if you're out tonight, don't forget, if you're on your bike, wear white
Evening, all

Have you seen your mother, baby, standing in the shadow?
Have you had another, baby, standing in the shadow?

I'm glad I opened your eyes
The have-nots would have tried to freeze you in ice

Have you seen your brother, baby, standing in the shadow?
Have you had another baby, standing in the shadow?

Well, I was just passing the time
I'm all alone, won't you give all your sympathy to mine?

Tell me a story about how you adore me
Live in the shadow, see through the shadow,
Glimpse through the shadow, tear at the shadow
Hate in the shadow, and love in your shadowy life

Have you seen your lover, baby, standing in the shadow?
Has he had another baby, standing in the shadow?

Just where have you been all your life?
Talking about all the people who would try anything twice

Have you seen your mother, baby, standing in the shadow?
Has she had another baby, standing in the shadow?

Well, you take your choice at the time
The brave old world or the slide to the depths of decline

You don't know what's going on
You've been away for far too long
You can't come back and think you are still mine

You're out of touch, my baby
My poor discarded baby
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

Well, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
You are left out
Out of there without a doubt
Cause baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

The girl who wants to run away
Discovers that she's had her day
It's no good you're thinking that you are still mine

You're out of touch, my baby
My poor unfaithful baby
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

Well baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Yes, you are left out
Out of there without a doubt 'cause
Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

You thought you were a clever girl
Giving up your social whirl
But you can't come back and be the first in line, oh no

You're obsolete my baby
My poor old-fashioned baby
I said baby, baby, baby you're out of time

Well, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Yes, you are left out
Out of there without a doubt
Cause baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

Sing the song now

Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

I got sunshine, on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside, I got the month of May

I guess, you say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl) my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl

I go so much honey, the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song, baby, than the birds in the trees

I guess, you say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl) my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey. (ooh)

I don't need no money, or count my pay
I've got all the riches, baby, one man can take

I guess, you say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl) my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl

I got sunshine, on a cloudy day
I even got the month of May
(My girl) My girl. I'm talkin' 'bout my girl


I don't want you to be high
I don't want you to be down
Don't want to tell you no lie
Just want you to be around
Please come right up to my ears
You will be able to hear what I say
Don't want you out in my world
Just you be my backstreet girl

Please don't be part of my life
Please keep yourself to yourself
Please don't you bother my wife
That way you won't get no help
Don't try to ride on my horse
You're rather common and coarse anyway
Don't want you out in my world
Just you be my backstreet girl

Please don't you call me at home
Please don't come knocking at night
Please never ring on the phone
Your manners are never quite right
Please take the favors I grant
Curtsy and look nonchalant, just for me
Don't want you part of my world
Just you be my backstreet girl

Please go home
Please go home

Well maybe I'm talking too fast
But I won't be the first or the last
In the sea of the thousand you cast
C'mon please go home

I don't have to ask what you do
I just have to look to get you
Means nothing to me to get through
Please go home

I don't want to be on my own
'Cause I can't talk much better alone
But I don't have to ring like a phone
Won't you please go home

Please go home

In some early part of your days
You were told of the devious ways
That you thought you could get without pay
Won't you please go home

You reach a state of your mind
Where it's madness to look and to find
Your false affections so kind
Please go home

Won't you please go home

What a drag it is getting old

"Kids are different today"
I hear ev'ry mother say
Mother needs something today to calm her down
And though she's not really ill
There's a little yellow pill
She goes running for the shelter of a mother's little helper
And it helps her on her way
Gets her through her busy day

"Things are different today"
I hear ev'ry mother say
Cooking fresh food for a husband's just a drag
So she buys an instant cake
And she burns a frozen steak
And goes running for the shelter of a mother's little helper
And two help her on her way
Get her through her busy day

Doctor please, some more of these
Outside the door, she took four more
What a drag it is getting old

"Men just aren't the same today"
I hear ev'ry mother say
They just don't appreciate that you get tired
They're so hard to satisfy
You could tranquilize your mind
So go running for the shelter of a mother's little helper
And four help you through the night
Help to minimize your plight

Doctor please, some more of these
Outside the door, she took four more
What a drag it is getting old

"Life's just much too hard today"
I hear ev'ry mother say
The pursuit of happiness just seems a bore
And if you take more of those
You will get an overdose
No more running for the shelter of a mother's little helper
They just helped you on your way
Through your busy dying day

Hey!

You can turn off and on more times
Than a flashin' neon sign
When you want you're bad
But you can be so kind

Just take it or leave it
Don't tell your friend
Just what you're gonna do now
You take it or leave it, it's just my life

There've been times when you tried
Makin' eyes at all my so called friends
Then you go, now you're back
But you can be so kind

Just take it or leave it
Don't tell your friend
Just what you're gonna do now
You take it or leave it, it's just my life

Oh, la-la-la-ta-ta-ta-ta-la-la-la-la
Oh, la-la-la-ta-ta-ta-ta-la-la
Oh, la-la-la-ta-ta-ta-ta-la-la-la-la
Oh, la-la-la-ta-ta-ta-ta-la-la

I'm sick and tired of the smile that you give
When you don't come home at night
You said you'd call, that's a lie
But you could be so kind

Just take it or leave it
Don't tell your friend
Just what you're gonna do now
You take it or leave it, it's just my life

Oh, la-la-la-ta-ta-ta-ta-la-la-la-la
Oh, la-la-la-ta-ta-ta-ta-la-la
Oh, la-la-la-ta-ta-ta-ta-la-la-la-la
Oh, la-la-la-ta-ta-ta-ta-la-la
Oh, la-la-la-ta-ta-ta-ta-la-la-la-la
Oh, la-la-la-ta-ta-ta-ta-la-la

A smile on your face
But not in your eyes
You're looking through me
You don't feel it inside

Get out and ride on, baby, ride on, baby
Ride on, baby, ride on, baby
I could pick your face out in an FBI file
You may look pretty but I can't say the same for your mind

Ah ah ah
You walk up to me
And try and look shy
The red round your eyes
Says that you ain't a child

Get out and ride on, baby, ride on, baby
Ride on, baby, ride on, baby
Well I've seen your face in a trashy magazine
You know where you're going but I don't like the places you've been

Ah ah ah

Get out and ride on, baby, ride on, baby
Ride on, baby, ride on, baby
I could pick your face out from the front or behind
You may look pretty but I can't say the same for your mind

Ah ah ah
Laugh it a bit
Give it a try
If I'm not impressed
You can still cry

Get out and ride on, baby, ride on, baby
Ride on, baby, ride on, baby
By the time you're thirty gonna look sixty-five
You won't look pretty and your friends will have kissed you goodbye

Ride on, baby
Ride on, baby

Since I was young I've been very hard to please
And I don't know wrong from right
But there is one thing I could never understand
Some of the sick things that a girl does to a man, so

I'm just sittin' on a fence
You can say I got no sense
Trying to make up my mind
Really is too horrifying
So I'm sittin on a fence

All of my friends at school grew up and settled down
And they mortgaged up their lives
One thing's not said too much, but I think it's true
They just get married cause there's nothing else to do, so

I'm just sittin' on a fence
You can say I got no sense
Trying to make up my mind
Really is too horrifying
So I'm sittin on a fence

I'm just sittin' on a fence
You can say I got no sense
Trying to make up my mind
Really is too horrifying
So I'm sittin on a fence

The day can come when you get old and sick and tired of life
You just never realize
Maybe the choice you made wasn't really right
But you go out and you don't come back at night, so

I'm just sittin' on a fence
You can say I got no sense
Trying to make up my mind
Really is too horrifying
So I'm sittin on a fence
