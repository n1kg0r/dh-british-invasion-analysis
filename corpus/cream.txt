
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, I feel free. [x8]

Feel when I dance with you,
We move like the sea.
You, you're all I want to know.
I feel free, I feel free, I feel free.

I can walk down the street, there's no one there
Though the pavements are one huge crowd.
I can drive down the road, my eyes don't see,
Though my mind wants to cry out loud.

I feel free, I feel free, I feel free.

I can walk down the street, there's no one there
Though the pavements are one huge crowd.
I can drive down the road; my eyes don't see,
Though my mind wants to cry out loud,
Though my mind wants to cry out loud.

Dance floor is like the sea,
Ceiling is the sky.
You're the sun and as you shine on me,
I feel free, I feel free, I feel free.


Driving in my car, smoking my cigar,
The only time I'm happy's when I play my guitar.

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

Singing in my yacht, what a lot I got,
Happiness is something that just cannot be bought.

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

I've been in and I'm out, I've been up and down,
I don't want to go until I've been all around.

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

What's it all about, anyone in doubt,
I don't want to go until I've found it all out.

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.


I'm a sleepy time baby, a sleepy time boy.
Work only maybe, life is a joy.

We'll have a sleepy time time.
We'll have a sleepy time time.
We'll have a sleepy time time.
We'll have a sleepy time time.
Sleepy time time.
Sleepy time time all the time.

Asleep in the daytime, asleep at night.
Life is all playtime; working ain't right.

We'll have a sleepy time time.
We'll have a sleepy time time.
We'll have a sleepy time time.
We'll have a sleepy time time.
Sleepy time time.
Sleepy time time all the time.

I have my Sunday, that ain't no lie.
But on Monday morning comes my favorite try.

We'll have a sleepy time time.
We'll have a sleepy time time.
We'll have a sleepy time time.
We'll have a sleepy time time.
Sleepy time time.
Sleepy time time all the time.


Dreaming about my love.
You bring me joy and hours of happiness,
More or less.
I dream my life away.

Waiting for you to come.
Changing my life for you to emptyness,
Meaningless.
Minutes just drift by.

I don't care if I get nowhere.
I can just dream and you'll be there.
What else is there to do?

Dreaming about my life.
Where are you now, and when will you
Come to me?
I dream my life away.

I don't care if I get nowhere.
I can just dream and you'll be there.
What else is there to do?

Dreaming about my love;
You bring me joy and hours of happiness,
More or less.
I dream my life away.

Dreaming, dreaming.


Ba, ba, ba [etc]

Who wants the worry, the hurry of city life.
Money, nothing funny, wasting the best of our life.

Sweet wine, hay making, sunshine day breaking.
We can wait till tomorrow.
Car speed, road calling, bird freed, leaf falling.
We can bide time.

Could fill spoons full of diamonds,
Could fill spoons full of gold.
Just a little spoon of your precious love
Will satisfy my soul.

Men lies about it.
Some of them cries about it.
Some of them dies about it.
Everything's a-fightin' about the spoonfull.
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonfull.
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonfull.
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonfull.
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonfull.

Could fill spoons full of coffee,
Could fill spoons full of tea.
Just a little spoon of your precious love;
Is that enough for me?

Men lies about it.

Everything's a-fightin' about the spoonfull.

That spoon, that spoon, that spoonfull.

Could fill spoons full of water,
Save them from the desert sands.
But a little spoon of your forty-five
Saved you from another man.

Men lies.
Some of them cries about it.
Some of them dies.
Everything's a-fightin' about it.
Everything's a-cryin' about it.

Little old, little old spoonfull.
Die'n about it
Cryin about it
That spoon, that spoon
Little old, little old spoonfull

That spoon, that spoon, that spoonfull.
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonfull.
Everything's a-diein' about it.

From four until late I was wringing my hands and crying.
From four until late I was wringing my hands and crying.
I believe to my soul that your daddy's Gulfport bound.

From four until late, she made me a no good barroom clown.
From four until late, she made me a no good barroom clown.
You know she won't do nothing but tear a good man's reputation down.

A woman is like a dresser, some man always running through its drawers.
A woman is like a dresser, some man always running through its drawers.
She cause so many men to wear an apron overall.

When I leave this town I will bid you fair farewell.
When I leave this town I will bid you fair farewell.
And when I return again, you'll have a great long story to tell.

There's a full time reservation
Made in a bar at the railway station,
And there's a story, a kind of fable,
On a card at the corner table.
On it is a message; been there some time.
It starts off, "The coffee tasted so fine..."

It says, "One day, this may find you,
These few words may just remind you.
We sat here together just to pass time;
You said how the coffee tasted so fine."

It goes on to say, "I love you.
If you should find this I must hear from you."
It gives a number but the name has faded away.
All that is left are just the words, "Maybe someday..."

That's the story and the fable;
Never leave alone from a corner table.
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo.
Doo doo-doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo.


Wrapping paper in the gutter
Moving slowly as the wind on the sea,
(Faces calling, waves moving)
In your picture on a wall of a house of old times.
(Can you hear me) Can you hear me
(Can you hear me) Wandering sadly?

In the city, feeling pretty,
Down and out and making love to you on the shore,
(Ruined buildings, faces empty)
In the picture as I gaze ahead and don't see
(That they're calling) That they're calling.
(That they're calling) Wandering sadly.

Shattered windows, stairs to nowhere.
(Hear you calling) Hear you calling
(Hear you calling) As I wander so sadly.

Wish I knew what you'd done to me;
Turned me on to things I never knew.
It's all broken, weeds are growing.
Wish I was going home to the house by the shore
(Where you loved me) Where you loved me,
(Where you loved me) Loved me so sadly.

Someday I'll get back, somehow I'll do it.
I'll arrive there and you'll be there to meet me.
(Walk together, tread the weeds down)
Kiss again in the picture on the wall
(Where I loved you) In the old house.
(Where I loved you) Loved you so well.


Strange brew - killin' what's inside of you

She's a witch of trouble in electric blue
In her own mad mind she's in love with you
With you
Now what you gonna do?
Strange brew - killin' what's inside of you

She's some kind of demon messin' in the glue
If you don't watch out it'll stick to you
To you
What kind of fool are you?
Strange brew - killin' what's inside of you

On a boat in the middle of a raging sea
She would make a scene for it all to be
Ignored
And wouldn't you be bored?
Strange brew - killin' what's inside of you

Strange brew, strange brew, strange brew, strange brew
Strange brew - killin' what's inside of you


It's gettin' near dawn
When lights close their tired eyes
I'll soon be with you my love
To give you my dawn surprise
I'll be with you darling soon
I'll be with you when the stars start falling

I've been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love

I'm with you my love
The light's shinin' through on you
Yes, I'm with you my love
It's the morning and just we two
I'll stay with you darling now
I'll stay with you till my seas are dried up

I've been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love

I'm with you my love
The light's shinin' through on you
Yes, I'm with you my love
It's the morning and just we two
I'll stay with you darling now
I'll stay with you till my seas are dried up

I've been waiting so long
I've been waiting so long
I've been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love


Outside my window is a tree.
Outside my window is a tree.
There only for me.
And it stands in the grey of the city,
No time for pity, for the tree or me.

There is a world of pain
In the falling rain
Around me.

Is there a reason for today?
Is there a reason for today?
Do you remember?
I can hear all the cries of the city,
No time for pity for a growing tree.

There is a world of pain
In the falling rain
Around me.

Outside my window is a tree.
Outside my window is a tree.
There only for me.
And it stands in the grey of the city,
No time for pity, for the tree or me.

There is a world of pain
In the falling rain
Around me.


Goner build myself a castle
High up in the clouds.
There'll be skies outside my window,
Lose these streets and crowds.

Dance the night away.

Will find myself an ocean,
Sail into the blue.
Live with golden swordfish,
Forget the time of you.

Dance the night away.

Dance myself to nothing,
Vanish from this place.
Gonna turn myself to shadow
So I can't see your face.

Dance the night away.


Don't take the wrong direction passing through,
Instead of deep reflection of what's true,
For it's a combination of judgments made by you
That cause a deep dejection all the way through.

No relaxation, no conversation, no variation
In a very dark blue, blue condition.

Early rising every day.
You must be enterprising in your way,
For you will hear no laughter, nor see the sun.
Life would be one disaster all the way through.

No relaxation, no conversation, no variation
In a very dark blue, blue condition.

Don't take the wrong direction passing through
Instead of deep reflection of what's true,
For it's a combination of judgments made by you
That cause a deep dejection all the way through.

No relaxation, no conversation, no variation
In a very dark blue, blue condition.

No relaxation, no conversation, no variation
In a very dark blue, blue condition.


You thought the leaden winter would bring you down forever
But you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun

And the colours of the sea bind your eyes with trembling mermaids
And you touch the distant beaches with tales of brave Ulysses
How his naked ears were tortured by the sirens sweetly singing
For the sparkling waves are calling you to kiss their white laced lips

And you see a girl's brown body dancing through the turquoise
And her footprints make you follow where the sky loves the sea
And when your fingers find her, she drowns you in her body
Carving deep blue ripples in the tissues of your mind

The tiny purple fishes run laughing through your fingers
And you want to take her with you to the hard land of the winter

Her name is Aphrodite and she rides a crimson shell
And you know you cannot leave her for you touched the distant sands
With tales of brave Ulysses, how his naked ears were tortured
By the sirens sweetly singing

The tiny purple fishes run laughing through your fingers
And you want to take her with you to the hard land of the winter


Coming to me in the morning, leaving me at night.
Coming to me in the morning, leaving me alone.
You've got that rainbow feel,
But the rainbow has a beard.

Running to me a-cryin', when he throws you out.
Running to me a-cryin', on your own again.
You've got that pure feel,
Such good responses,
But the picture has a mustache.

You're comin' to me with that soulful look on your face.
Coming lookin' like you've never ever done one wrong thing.

You're comin' to me with that soulful look on your face.
You're comin' lookin' like you've never ever done one wrong thing.

So many fantastic colours, I feel in a wonderland.
Many fantastic colours, makes me feel so good.
You've got that pure feel,
Such good responses,
Got that rainbow feel,
But the rainbow has a beard.


Please open your eyes,
Try to realise.
I found out today we're going wrong,
We're going wrong.

Please open your mind,
See what you can find.
I found out today we're going wrong,
We're going wrong.

We're going wrong,
We're going wrong,
We're going wrong.


If you lose your money, great God, don't lose your mind.
If you lose your money, great God, don't lose your mind.
And if you lose your woman, please don't fool with mine.

I'm gonna buy me a bulldog, watch my lady whilst I sleep.
I'm gonna buy me a bulldog, watch my lady whilst I sleep.
'Cause women these days, they're so doggone crooked,
That they might make a 'fore day creep.

Well, you can't watch your wife and your outside women, too.
You know you can't watch your wife and your outside womens, too.
Cause when you're out with your women, your wife will be at home,
Cooking your food, doing your dirt, buddy what you trying to do?

You can't watch your wife and your outside womens, too.

Take it back, take it back, take that thing right outa here.
Right away, far away, take that thing right outa here.

Don't let them take me to where streams are red.
I want to stay here and sleep in my own bed.
Need all your loving, long blonde hair,
Don't let them take me 'cos I easily scare.
Take it back, take it back, take that thing right outa here.

Take it back, take it back, take that thing right outa here.
Right away, far away, take that thing right outa here.

I got this great need, the need to stay alive.
Not ashamed of my creed, I've got to survive.
So come on baby, don't go 'way,
Just let them save me for a rainy day.
Take it back, take it back, take that thing right outa here.

Don't go to places where it won't shine in the dark.
So come on baby, don't go away,
Just let them save me for a rainy day.
Take it back, take it back, take that thing right outa here.


Are we wollin'?  A one, a two, a free, a four...

A mother was washing her baby one night,
The youngest of ten and a delicate mite.
The mother was poor and the baby was thin,
'Twas naught but an skelingtin covered with skin.

The mother turned 'round for a soap off the rack.
She was only a moment but when she turned back
Her baby had gone, and in anguish she cried,
"Oh, where 'as my baby gone?"  The angels replied:

Oh, your baby has gone down the plug 'ole.
Oh, your baby has gone down the plug.
The poor little thing was so skinny and thin,
He should 'ave been washed in a jug, in a jug.

Your baby is perfectly happy;
He won't need a bath anymore.
He's a-muckin' about with the angels above,
Not lost but gone before.

Thankyou,
Do you wanna do it again?


In the white room with black curtains near the station.
Black-roof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings.
Silver horses run down moonbeams in your dark eyes.
Dawn-light smiles on you leaving, my contentment.

I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines;
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves.

You said no strings could secure you at the station.
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows.
I walked into such a sad time at the station.
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning.

I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back;
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves.

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd.
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten.
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes.
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings.

I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd;
Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves.


One summer day, she went away
Gone and left me, she's gone to stay
She's gone, but I don't worry
I'm sittin' on top of the world

All the summer, worked on this farm
Had to take Christmas in my overalls
She's gone, but I don't worry
I'm sittin' on top of the world

Going down to the freight yard
Gonna catch me a freight train
Gonna leave this town
Work done got too hard
She's gone, but I don't worry
I'm sittin' on top of the world

[Goodbye Cream:]

One summer day, she went away
Gone and left me, she's gone to stay
She's gone, but I don't worry
Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world

All last summer, worked on this farm
Had to take Christmas in my overalls
She's gone, gone, but I don't worry, no
Cause I'm sittin', sittin' on top of the world

Going down to the freight yard, yeh, yeh, yeh
Gonna catch me a freight train
Gonna leave this town, yeh, yeh, yeh

It is a cold winter,
Away is the songbird.
And gone is her traveller,
She waits at home.

The sun is on holiday,
No leaves on the trees.
The animals sleep
While cold North wind blows.

The snowflakes are falling,
The roof a white blanket.
There's ice on the window pane,
She waits alone.

She sits by the fireside,
The room is so warm.
Her children are sleeping,
She waits in their home.

Passing the time.
Passing the time, everything fine.
Passing the time, having the wine.
Passing the time, drinking red wine.
Passing the time, drinking red wine.
Passing the time, drinking red wine.
Passing the time, everything fine.
Passing the time, drinking red wine.
Passing the time, everything fine.
Passing the time, wine and time rhyme.
Passing the time.

It is a long winter,
Away is the summer.
She waits for her traveller
So far from home.

She sits by the fireside,
The room is so warm.
There's ice on the window,
She's lonely alone.


Let's go down to where it's clean
To see the time that might have been.
The tides have carried off the beach.
As you said,
The sun is out of reach.

Let's go back to where it's clean
To see what year it might have been.
The roads have carried off the smiles.
As you said,
To judge them at the trials.

Let's go back to now that's bad
To see the time we might have had.
The rails have carried off the trains.
As you said,
I'll never come again, again, again, again.


Pressed Rat and Warthog have closed down their shop,
They didn't want to - 'twas all they had got.
Selling atonal apples, amplified heat,
And Pressed Rat's collection of dog legs and feet.

Sadly they left, telling no one goodbye.
Pressed Rat wore red jodhpurs - Warthog a striped tie.
Between them, they carried a three-legged sack,
Went straight round the corner and never came back.

Pressed Rat and Warthog have closed down their shop.
The bad captain madman had told them to stop
Selling atonal apples, amplified heat,
And pressed rat's collection of dog legs and feet.

The bad captain madman had ordered their fate.
He laughed and stomped off with a nautical gate.
The gate turned into a deroga tree
And his pegleg got woodworm and broke into three.

Pressed Rat and Warthog have closed down their shop,
They didn't want to - 'twas all they had got.
Selling atonal apples, amplified heat,
And Pressed Rat's collection of dog legs and feet.

When the city of Atlantis stood serene above the sea,
Long time before our time when the world was free,
Those were the days.

Golden cymbals flying on ocarina sounds,
Before wild Medusa's serpents gave birth to hell
Disguised as heaven.

Those were the days, yes they were, those were the days.
Those were their ways, miracles everywhere, are they now?
They're gone.
Those were their ways, yes they were, those were their ways.
Those were the days, yes they were, those were the days.

Tie your painted shoes and dance, blue daylight in your hair,
Overhead a noiseless eagle fans a flame.
Wonder everywhere.

Those were the days, yes they were, those were the days.
Those were their ways, miracles everywhere, are they now?
They're gone.
Those were their ways, yes they were, those were their ways.
Those were the days, yes they were, those were the days.


Born under a bad sign.
I've been down since I began to crawl.
If it wasn't for bad luck,
I wouldn't have no luck at all.

Bad luck and trouble's my only friend,
I've been down ever since I was ten.

Born under a bad sign.
I've been down since I began to crawl.
If it wasn't for bad luck,
I wouldn't have no luck at all.

You know, wine and women is all I crave.
A big bad woman's gonna carry me to my grave.

Born under a bad sign.
I've been down since I began to crawl.

I wouldn't have no luck at all.

Born under a bad sign.

Upon this street where time has died.
The golden treat you never tried.
In times of old, in days gone by.
If I could catch your dancing eye.

It was on the way,
On the road to dreams, yeah.
Now my heart's drowned in no love streams, yeah.

The street is cold, its trees are gone.
The story's told the dark has won.
Once we set sail to catch a star.
We had to fail, it was too far.

It was on the way,
On the road to dreams, yeah.
Now my heart's drowned in no love streams, yeah.

I felt the wind shout like a drum.
You said, "My friend, love's end has come."
It couldn't last, had to stop.
You drained it all to the last drop.

It was on the way,
On the road to dreams, yeah.
Now my heart's drowned in no love streams, yeah.

Now my heart's drowned in no love streams, yeah.

On this dark street the sun is black.
The winter life is coming back.
On this dark street it's cold inside.
There's no retreat from time that's died.

It was on the way,
On the road to dreams.
Now my heart's drowned in no love streams, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Now my heart's drowned in no love streams, yeah.
Now my heart's drowned in no love.


I went down to the crossroads
Fell down on my knees
Down to the crossroads
Fell down on my knees
Asked the Lord above for mercy
"Save me, if you please"

I went down to the crossroads
Tried to flag a ride
Down to the crossroads
Tried to flag a ride
Nobody seemed to know me
Everybody passed me by

Well, I'm going down to Rosedale
Take my rider by my side
Going down to Rosedale
Take my rider by my side
You can still barrelhouse, baby
On the riverside

Going down to Rosedale
Take my rider by my side
Going down to Rosedale
Take my rider by my side
You can still barrelhouse, baby
On the riverside

You can run, you can run
Tell my friend boy Willie Brown
Run, you can run
Tell my friend boy Willie Brown
And I'm standing at the crossroads
Believe I'm sinking down


Could fill spoons full of diamonds,
Could fill spoons full of gold.
Just a little spoon of your precious love
Will satisfy my soul.

Men lies about it.
Some of them cries about it.
Some of them dies about it.
Everything's a-fightin' about the spoonfull.
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonfull.
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonfull.
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonfull.
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonfull.

Could fill spoons full of coffee,
Could fill spoons full of tea.
Just a little spoon of your precious love;
Is that enough for me?

Men lies about it.
Some of them cries about it.
Some of them dies about it.
Everything's a-fightin' about the spoonfull.
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonfull.
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonfull.
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonfull.
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonfull.

Could fill spoons full of water,
Save them from the desert sands.
But a little spoon of your forty-five
Saved you from another man.

Men lies.
Some of them cries about it.
Some of them dies.
Everything's a-fightin' about it.
Everything's a-cryin' about it.
Everything's a-diein' about it.
Everything's a-cryin' about it.
Everything's a-liein' about it.

Little old, little old spoonfull.
Die'n about it
Cryin about it
That spoon, that spoon
Little old, little old spoonfull

That spoon, that spoon, that spoonfull.
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonfull.
Everything's a-diein' about it.

I'm so glad, I'm so glad

I'm so glad, I'm so glad
I'm glad, I'm glad, I'm glad

I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do

Hey now baby, get into my big black car
Hey now baby, get into my big black car
I wanna just show you what my politics are.

I'm a political man and I practice what I preach
I'm a political man and I practice what I preach
So don't deny me baby, not while you're in my reach.

I support the left, tho' I'm leanin', leanin' to the right
I support the left, tho' I'm leanin' to the right
But I'm just not there when it's coming to a fight.

Hey now baby, get into my big black car
Hey now baby, get into my big black car
I wanna just show you what my politics are.

[Goodbye Cream:]

Hey, hey now baby, get into my big black car
Hey now baby, get into my big black car
I wanna just show you what my politics are.

I support the left, tho' I'm leanin'to the right
I support the left, tho' I'm leanin' to the right
But I'm just not there when, when it's coming to a fight.

Political man and I practice what I preach
Political man and I practice what I preach
But I'm just not there, when you're in my reach.

Hey now baby, get into my big black car
Hey now baby, get into my big black car
I wanna just show you what my politics are.

Hey, hey, hey
I wanna just show you what my politics are.


One summer day, she went away
Gone and left me, she's gone to stay
She's gone, but I don't worry
I'm sittin' on top of the world

All the summer, worked on this farm
Had to take Christmas in my overalls
She's gone, but I don't worry
I'm sittin' on top of the world

Going down to the freight yard
Gonna catch me a freight train
Gonna leave this town
Work done got too hard
She's gone, but I don't worry
I'm sittin' on top of the world

[Goodbye Cream:]

One summer day, she went away
Gone and left me, she's gone to stay
She's gone, but I don't worry
Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world

All last summer, worked on this farm
Had to take Christmas in my overalls
She's gone, gone, but I don't worry, no
Cause I'm sittin', sittin' on top of the world

Going down to the freight yard, yeh, yeh, yeh
Gonna catch me a freight train
Gonna leave this town, yeh, yeh, yeh
Work done got too hard
She's gone, but I don't worry
Cause I'm sittin', I'm sittin'on top of the world


Thinkin' 'bout the times you drove in my car.
Thinkin' that I might have drove you too far.
And I'm thinkin' 'bout the love that you laid on my table.

I told you not to wander 'round in the dark.
I told you 'bout the swans, that they live in the park.
Then I told you 'bout our kid: now he's married to Mabel.

Yes, I told you that the light goes up and down.
Don't you notice how the wheel goes 'round?
And you better pick yourself up from the ground
Before they bring the curtain down.
Yes, before they bring the curtain down.

Ah Ah Ah, yeh yeh yeh
Ah Ah Ah, yeh yeh yeh

Talkin' 'bout a girl that looks quite like you.
She didn't have the time to wait in the queue.
She cried away her life since she fell off the cradle.


When I was young they gave me a mongrel piano,
Spent all my time inventing the cup of tea.
Writing your name in the sea,
Banging my fav'rite head.

Missing the last bed, waving a cheery herring,
Balancing brass bands on the tip of my toe.
Phoning your home from my tree,
Drinking my fav'rite loch.

When I was old they gave me a model factory,
I met three salads out on the motorway.
Leaving your name at the door,
Breaking my fav'rite egg.

Missing the walrus, sharing my last banana,
Balancing zeppelins on the end of my nose.
Calling your name in the zoo,
Blowing my fav'rite mind.


Dainties in a jam-jar, parson's colour in the sky.
Water in a fountain doesn't get me very high.
Moby Dick and Albert making out with Captain Bligh.
So you know what you know in your head.
Will you, won't you, do you, don't you know when a head's dead?
What a bringdown!

Winter leader Lou is growin' 'ampsteads in the North.
Betty B's been wearin' daisies since the twenty-fourth.
Wears a gunner when there's one more coming forth.
And you know what you know in your head.
Will you, won't you, do you, don't you wanna go to bed?
What a bringdown!

There's a tea-leaf about in the family,
Full of nothin' their fairy tale.
There's a tea-leaf a-floatin' now for Rosalie,
They'll believe in ding-dong bell.

Take a butchers at the dodginesses of old Bill.
Aristotle's orchestra are living on the pill.
One of them gets very very prickly when he's ill.
And you know what you know in your head.
Will you, won't you, do you, don't you wanna make more bread?
What a bringdown!


Twice upon a time in the valley of the tears
The auctioneer is bidding for a box of fading years
And the elephants are dancing on the graves of squealing mice.
Anyone for tennis, wouldn't that be nice?

And the ice creams are all melting on the streets of bloody beer
While the beggars stain the pavements with flourescent Christmas cheer
And the Bentley driving guru is putting up his price.
Anyone for tennis, wouldn't that be nice?

And the prophets in the boutiques give out messages of hope
With jingle bells and fairy tales and blind colliding scopes
And you can tell they're all the same underneath the pretty lies.
Anyone for tennis, wouldn't that be nice?

The yellow Buddhist monk is burning brightly at the zoo
You can bring a bowl of rice and then a glass of water too
And fate is setting up the chessboard while death rolls out the dice.
Anyone for tennis, wouldn't that be nice?
