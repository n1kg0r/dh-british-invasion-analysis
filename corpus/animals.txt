
Now lets hear the story of Bo Diddley and the Rock n Roll scene in general
Bo Diddley was born Elias McDaniels in a place called McCoom,
Missississipi about 1926
He moved to Chicago about 1938
Where his name was eventually changed to Bo Diddley

He practiced the guitar everyday and sometimes into the night
Till his papa's hair began to turn white
His Pa said Son, listen hear, I know
You can stay but that guitar has just gotta go
So he pulled his hat down over his eyes
Headed out for them Western Skies
I think Bob Dylan said that
He hit New York City

He began to play at the Apollo in Harlem
Good scene there everybody raving
One day, one night, came a Cadillac with four head lights
Came a man with a big, long, fat, cigar said, C'mere son, I'm gonna make you a star
Bo Diddley said, Uh..whats in it for me?
Man said, Shut your mouth son , play the guitar and you just wait and see

Well, that boy made it, he made it real big
And so did the rest of the rock n roll scene along with him
And a white guy named Johnny Otis took Bo Diddleys rhythm
He changed it into hand-jive and it went like this
In a little old country town one day
A little old country band began to play
Add two guitars and a beat up saxophone
When the drummer said, boy, those cats begin to roam
Oh baby oh we oh oh
Ooh la la that rock and roll
Ya hear me oh we oh oh
Ooh la la that rock and roll

Then in the U.S. music scene there was big changes made
Due to circumstances beyond our control such as payola
The rock n roll scene died after two years of solid rock and you got discs like,
Ah...
Take good care of my baby
Please don't ever make her blue and so forth

About, ah, one year later in a place called Liverpool in England
Four young lads with mop haircuts began to sing stuff like, ah...
It's been a hard days night and I;ve been working like a dog and so on
In a place called Richmond in Surrey, whay down in the deep south
They got guys with long hair down their back singing
I wanna be your lover baby I wanna be your man yeah and all that jazz

Now we've doing this number, Bo Diddley, for quite some time now
Bo Diddley visited this country last year
We were playing at the Club A Gogo in Newcastle, our home town
The doors opened one night and to our surprise walked in the man himself, Bo Diddley
Along with him was Jerome Green, his maraca man, and the Duchess, his gorgeous sister

And a we were doing this number
Along with them came the Rolling Stones, the Mersey Beats,
They're all standing around diggin' it
And I overheard Bo Diddley talkin'
He turned around to Jermone Green
And he said, Hey, Jerome? What do you think these guys doin' our..our material?
Jerome said, Uh, where's the bar, man? Please show me to the bar...
He turned around the Duchess
And he said, Hey Duchess...what do you think of these young guys doin' our material?
She said, I don't know. I only came across here to see the changin' of the
Guards and all that jazz.

Well, Bo Diddley looked up and said to me, with half closed eyes and a smile,
He said Man, took off his glasses,
He said, Man, that sure is the biggest load of rubbish I ever heard in my life...

Hey Bo Diddley
Oh Bo Diddley
Yeah Bo Diddley
Oh Bo Diddley
Yeah Bo Diddley

I've been around the world, it's true
Searchin' for someone exactly like you
I finally found a love that's true
You heard story, you heard just what I said
The one that I love she might as well be dead
Finally found a love that's true, oh, oh, oh, oh
You heard my story you know how I feel
You got me spinnin' like a spinnin' wheel
And finally found a love that true
I've been around the world, it's true
Searchin' for someone exactly like you
And finally found a love that's true
And finally found a love that's true


Early in the morning
Sitting here all alone
Waitin' for my baby
To call me on the telephone
I'm in love, I'm in love
Feel good all the time

Turning from side to side
The woman that I'm lovin'
She stays on my mind

Feels good all the time
Now let's get it now baby!

(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)

She walks by, the men folk stand and gawp
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
She winks her eye, the brass lights turn to toast
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
She's got a lot of what they call the most
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)

The girl can't help it she was born to please
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
And if I go to her on my bended knees
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
'Cause I'm hopin' obviously
That someday her answer will be
The girl can't help it 'cause she's in love with me
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)

She'll mess around with every mother's son
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
If I give her good loving she says "baby well done"
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
She'd make my grandpa feel like twenty-one
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)

The girl can't help it she was born to please
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
And if I go to her on my bended knees

I had a friend one time, at least I thought he was my friend
For he came to me, said "I ain't got no place to go"
I said "take it easy man, you can come home to my house,
I'll get you a pillow where you can rest your head"
Took him home with me, let him in my house,
Let him drive my Cadillac that I could not afford
When I found out he'd been messin' around with my baby

You know I'm mad like Al Capone (I'm burnin' up)
I said I'm mad (I'm burnin' up)

Yeah baby, alright baby (I'm burnin' up)
I'm mad, come on (I'm burnin' up)

Took him home with me, introduced him to my baby,
He began to talk to her, made her think the moon was blue
You know I think I ought to tell you daddy
I'm mad, I said I'm mad with you
I don't know what I'm gonna do to you
I might drown you, I might shoot you
I just don't know because I'm mad

I said I'm mad (I'm burnin' up)
You know I'm mad (I'm burnin' up)
I don't have to tell you I'm mad (I'm burnin' up)

I said I'm mad (I'm burnin' up)
Yeah yeah yeah (I'm burnin' up)

The phone boy took the message and he wrote it on the wall

I said help me information get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd phone me here from Memphis Tennessee
Her home is on the south side, high up on a ridge
About a half a mile from the Mississipi bridge

But we were pulled apart now 'cause her momma did not agree
And tore apart our happy home in Memphis Tennessee

With hurry home drops on her cheek that trickl'd from her eye
Marie is only six years old, so information please

There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God, I know I'm one

My mother was a tailor
She sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's all drunk

[Organ Solo]

Oh mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun

Well, I got one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

Well, there is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God, I know I'm one


Sit here and wonder what am I so blue
Is it because I'm still in love with you ?
Blue blue feeling got me down today
Blue blue feeling, my baby's gone away

Now that she's gone, I don't know what I'll do
I guess I'll have to find, find somebody new
Blue blue feeling got me down today
Blue blue feeling, my baby's gone away

Baby please don't leave me, oh don't leave me

Now that she's gone, I'm feeling kind of blue
I guess I'll have to find, find somebody new
Blue blue feeling got me down today
Blue blue feeling, my baby's gone away

Well baby please don't leave me
Baby please don't go
Awh!Honey child don't leave me now,
Baby please, baby please

For he came to me, said "I ain't got no place to go"
I said "take it easy man, you can come home to my house,
I'll get you a pillow where you can rest your head"
Took him home with me, let him in my house,
Let him drive my Cadillac that I could not afford
When I found out he'd been messin' around with my baby

You know I'm mad like Al Capone (I'm burnin' up)
I said I'm mad (I'm burnin' up)

You know I'm mad (I'm burnin' up) you know I'm mad
Yeah baby, alright baby (I'm burnin' up)
I'm mad, come on (I'm burnin' up)

Took him home with me, introduced him to my baby,
He began to talk to her, made her think the moon was blue
You know I think I ought to tell you daddy
I'm mad, I said I'm mad with you
I don't know what I'm gonna do to you
I might drown you, I might shoot you
I just don't know because I'm mad

I said I'm mad (I'm burnin' up)
You know I'm mad (I'm burnin' up)
I don't have to tell you I'm mad (I'm burnin' up)
I'm mad with you yeah (I'm burnin' up)
I said I'm mad (I'm burnin' up)
Yeah yeah yeah (I'm burnin' up)
I said I'm mad (I'm burnin' up)
You know I'm mad, oh baby I'm mad
Oh I said I'm mad, you know I'm mad, oh baby I'm mad

Now lets hear the story of Bo Diddley and the Rock n Roll scene in general
Bo Diddley was born Elias McDaniels in a place called McCoom,
Missississipi about 1926
He moved to Chicago about 1938
Where his name was eventually changed to Bo Diddley

He practiced the guitar everyday and sometimes into the night
Till his papa's hair began to turn white
His Pa said Son, listen hear, I know
You can stay but that guitar has just gotta go
So he pulled his hat down over his eyes
Headed out for them Western Skies
I think Bob Dylan said that
He hit New York City

He began to play at the Apollo in Harlem
Good scene there everybody raving
One day, one night, came a Cadillac with four head lights
Came a man with a big, long, fat, cigar said, C'mere son, I'm gonna make you a star
Bo Diddley said, Uh..whats in it for me?
Man said, Shut your mouth son , play the guitar and you just wait and see

Well, that boy made it, he made it real big
And so did the rest of the rock n roll scene along with him
And a white guy named Johnny Otis took Bo Diddleys rhythm
He changed it into hand-jive and it went like this
In a little old country town one day
A little old country band began to play
Add two guitars and a beat up saxophone
When the drummer said, boy, those cats begin to roam
Oh baby oh we oh oh
Ooh la la that rock and roll
Ya hear me oh we oh oh
Ooh la la that rock and roll

Then in the U.S. music scene there was big changes made
Due to circumstances beyond our control such as payola
The rock n roll scene died after two years of solid rock and you got discs like,
Ah...
Take good care of my baby
Please don't ever make her blue and so forth

About, ah, one year later in a place called Liverpool in England
Four young lads with mop haircuts began to sing stuff like, ah...
It's been a hard days night and I;ve been working like a dog and so on
In a place called Richmond in Surrey, whay down in the deep south
They got guys with long hair down their back singing
I wanna be your lover baby I wanna be your man yeah and all that jazz

Now we've doing this number, Bo Diddley, for quite some time now
Bo Diddley visited this country last year
We were playing at the Club A Gogo in Newcastle, our home town
The doors opened one night and to our surprise walked in the man himself, Bo Diddley
Along with him was Jerome Green, his maraca man, and the Duchess, his gorgeous sister

And a we were doing this number
Along with them came the Rolling Stones, the Mersey Beats,
They're all standing around diggin' it
And I overheard Bo Diddley talkin'
He turned around to Jermone Green
And he said, Hey, Jerome? What do you think these guys doin' our..our material?
Jerome said, Uh, where's the bar, man? Please show me to the bar...
He turned around the Duchess
And he said, Hey Duchess...what do you think of these young guys doin' our material?
She said, I don't know. I only came across here to see the changin' of the
Guards and all that jazz.

Well, Bo Diddley looked up and said to me, with half closed eyes and a smile,
He said Man, took off his glasses,
He said, Man, that sure is the biggest load of rubbish I ever heard in my life...

Hey Bo Diddley
Oh Bo Diddley
Yeah Bo Diddley
Oh Bo Diddley
Yeah Bo Diddley


Baby, do you understand me now
Sometimes I feel a little mad
But don't you know that no one alive
Can always be an angel
When things go wrong I seem to be bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Baby, sometimes I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And sometimes it seems that all I have to do is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy I want you to know
That I never mean to take it out on you
Life has its problems and I get my share
And that's one thing I never meant to do
Because I love you
Oh, Oh baby don't you know I'm human
Have thoughts like any other one
Sometimes I find myself long regretting
Some foolish thing some little simple thing I've done

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood ...


Why am I lonely, why do I cry,
Am I gonna be a lonely one till the day that I die?
Yes, you don't be there while I sit here alone,
I can't believe my eyes, you've up and gone

I get so weary, weary and blue,
When I think about the good times that we two once knew
You, you know the reason why I sit here alone,
I can't believe my eyes, you've up and gone.

Once I have you here beside me,
When I had you here beside me I had your love to guide me,
And nothing, no nothing, no nothing, you don't know but from now on.

Lord I get so weary, lonely and blue
When I think about the good times, baby, we once knew.
You, you know the reason why I sit here alone,
I can't believe my yes, you've up and gone

All right babe

Once I had you here beside me,
When I had you here beside me,
I had your love to guide me and nothing, no nothing, no nothing could go wrong, yeah

Lord I get so weary, lonely and blue
I keep on remembering little things, baby, that we used to do.
You know the reason you were my lonely one,
I can't believe my eyes, you've up and gone.

I can't believe what I'm seeing babe,
Everything in between me and you
You walked out of my door,
Bye bye baby


My baby found a new place to go
Hangs around town at the Club-a-gogo
Takes all my money for the picture show
But I know she spends it at the club-a-gogo
Let's go babe, let's go, I love you, come on, yeah!

It's one of the coolest spots in town
You take too much tho' it's bound to get you down
She's got a boy-friend they call Big Joe
He's a big shot at the club-a-gogo
Babe, come on, let's go, let's go babe, yeah!

Now they play the blues there every day and every night
Everybody monkeys and they feel alright
Ask my friend, Meyer he'll tell you so
That there ain't no place like the club-a-gogo
Let's go babe, ah let's go, come on it's alright, s'alright, s'alright
Yeah!

I guess I can't blame her for goin' up there tho'
The place is full of soul, heart and soul, baby

I want you to come back home baby
Baby, please set me free...


You know I got a letter from a friend of mine
In Newcastle-Upon-a'Tyne the other day
He said to me "Eric I heard you've been havin' some trouble down in the smoke with the girls"
He said "You wanna catch that flyin' Scotsman back up here to Newcastle,
'Cause we've got enough females to go around up here
And I can figure you can find yourself a little somethin'
And because people around here don't go away stealin' each others loved ones away from one another,
Like they do down there in the smoke"
He also said in the letter that, ah,
Things don't happen like that here on Tyne
And I believed every word he said, now
Things don't happen like that here on Tyne
One more thing he told me now
Things don't happen like that here on Tyne
He said to me babe
Things don't happen like that here on Tyne
He said, all right, all right
So I'm sayin' to you who are listen'
If you've been unlucky in love
And you've lost somebody love
And you hear a voice that comes to you in the middle of the night and says
It says I want you to get on up
Listen to me,
I want you to get on up and find yourself another one
If your havin' breakfast one morning and out from behind the teapot a little voice says,
Listen, Hey! I want you to get on up now
If your out in the mornin' on your job
And a voice come to you on your job and says,
Get up! Get Up!
And you know its not the foreman
Its a little voice that says
You wanna get up and walk ...(?) women
Go on and find yourself somebody
That's what you'd better do.
Because I'll tell you one thing
There's one thing I found out
One thing I found out
Took me a long time to find it out
Yeah it took me a long time to find out
But I, .think I got it now
Oh yeah..
One monkey don't stop no show
Yes, its true baby
One monkey don't stop no show
Don't let one monkey stop up your show
One monkey don't stop no show
One monkey don't stop no show


"This song was written by John Lee Hooker
About his wife, her name is Maudie
Everytime he has an arguement with her
He has to write a new verse to keep her happy
He was over here at London a short while back
And he taught me this song .......?"
Oh Maudie, baby, I love you
Mmm, baby, I love you
Yeah, you've been gone so long
Girl, I miss you so
Oh Maudie, why did you hurt me?
Mmm, Maudie, I said why did you hurt me?
You know I need your sweet lovin' like a flower needs the rain
Sometimes when they'd have an argument
He'd take her by the hand and say,
"Maudie, you know I love you
You know I need you
And I got just one thing to say baby .ho!"
Hey Maudie, baby don't you know I love you
Oh, Maudie, I said baby don't you know I love you
I've been gone so long, God, I miss you so much
Sometimes Johns old lady
She'd turn around to him and say,
"John, if you don't quit your messin' around baby,
I'm gonna walk right outta that door
With my bag in my hand."
John would say, "Hey!"
Well, Maudie, sweet little girl, baby,
Oh Maudie, be my sweet little girl, baby,
When you touch my hand
My head is all in a whirl now baby
I love you Maudie
I said I love you Maudie
Oh, love you Maudie
Ooh, love you Maudie
You know I need, I need, I need, need, yeah
I said Maudie, baby, I love you
Oh Maudie, baby, I love you
I love you Maudie
You've been gone so long,
How I've missed you too much
I love you.


Girl, what have I done?
For you to mistreat me this way
I'm left out of everything
Each and every day
I'm just an outcast
I don´t know how long I'm goin' to last
Lord, when will it be over
Baby, come on and help me discover
I guess I've got to do my best
But my girl gives me unhappiness
Lord, no matter how hard I try
Tears keep comin' down from my eyes
I'm just an outcast
I don't know how long I´m gonna last
Lord, when will it be over
Baby, come on and help me discover
[Instrumental break: guitar-organ exchanges]
You know, I'm just a young boy
But she treats me like last year's toy
I want her, for myself
I want her and nobody else
I'm just an outcast
Don't know how long I can last
Oh, when will it be over
Baby, come on and help me discover
I'm just an outcast--
Waauuggh!--
An' I don't know how long I can last--
Ow!--
I think I can make it--
I've got to try and make it--
Waauuggh!

"This song was written by John Lee Hooker
About his wife, her name is Maudie
Everytime he has an arguement with her
He has to write a new verse to keep her happy
He was over here at London a short while back
And he taught me this song .......?"
Oh Maudie, baby, I love you
Mmm, baby, I love you
Yeah, you've been gone so long
Girl, I miss you so
Oh Maudie, why did you hurt me?
Mmm, Maudie, I said why did you hurt me?
You know I need your sweet lovin' like a flower needs the rain
Sometimes when they'd have an argument
He'd take her by the hand and say,
"Maudie, you know I love you
You know I need you
And I got just one thing to say baby .ho!"
Hey Maudie, baby don't you know I love you
Oh, Maudie, I said baby don't you know I love you
I've been gone so long, God, I miss you so much
Sometimes Johns old lady
She'd turn around to him and say,
"John, if you don't quit your messin' around baby,
I'm gonna walk right outta that door
With my bag in my hand."
John would say, "Hey!"
Well, Maudie, sweet little girl, baby,
Oh Maudie, be my sweet little girl, baby,
When you touch my hand
My head is all in a whirl now baby
I love you Maudie
I said I love you Maudie
Oh, love you Maudie
Ooh, love you Maudie
You know I need, I need, I need, need, yeah
I said Maudie, baby, I love you
Oh Maudie, baby, I love you
I love you Maudie
You've been gone so long,
How I've missed you too much
I love you.

To feel you lips close to mine and hold you tight.
Well, you'll be my only love my whole life through.
Baby, Baby, nobody else, nobody else will do.

Well, I want you close to me
That's all I know.
And I want you all the time
'Cause darling I love you so.

What am I living for if not for you?

Baby, Baby, nobody else, nobody else will do.

Girl, what have I done?
For you to mistreat me this way
I'm left out of everything
Each and every day
I'm just an outcast
I don´t know how long I'm goin' to last
Lord, when will it be over
Baby, come on and help me discover
I guess I've got to do my best
But my girl gives me unhappiness
Lord, no matter how hard I try
Tears keep comin' down from my eyes
I'm just an outcast
I don't know how long I´m gonna last
Lord, when will it be over
Baby, come on and help me discover
[Instrumental break: guitar-organ exchanges]
You know, I'm just a young boy
But she treats me like last year's toy
I want her, for myself
I want her and nobody else
I'm just an outcast
Don't know how long I can last
Oh, when will it be over
Baby, come on and help me discover
I'm just an outcast--
Waauuggh!--
An' I don't know how long I can last--
Ow!--
I think I can make it--
I've got to try and make it--
