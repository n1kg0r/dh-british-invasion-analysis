
Beautiful Delilah, sweet as apple pie
Always gets a second look from fellas passing by
Every time you see her, she's with a different guy
Beautiful Delilah, that's the reason why

Rebecca don't allow me fool around with you
You are so tantalizing, you just can't be true

Beautiful Delilah, dressed in the latest styles
Swinging like a pendulum, walking down the aisle
Sees so many guys, speaks so low and mild
One day she will marry, settle down, after a while

Rebecca don't allow me, fool around with you
You are so tantalizing, you just can't be true

Beautiful Delilah, bathing in the sun
Audience of 17, and noticed not a one
Local Casanova who wouldn't be outdone
Let her steal his heart away, she break it just for fun

Rebecca don't allow me, fool around with you
You are so tantalizing, you just can't be true


You know you're so mystifying
You know you're so mystifying

Well, help me, baby, get a message through
You leave my mouth wide open with the things that you do
First you say you love me, then you say that we're through
You know you're so mystifying, can't believe it's true

You know you're so mystifying
You know you're so mystifying

You know that every time I see you walking down the street
You got a mystifying wiggle from your head to your feet
You got a shock wave pulsating rhythm through my brain
You know you're so mystifying, you just ain't the same

You know you're so mystifying
You know you're so mystifying

You know you're so mystifying
You know you're so mystifying

Well, mystify me by the way that you walk
You even mystify me by the way you talk
Go from one day to the next if you'll be mine
Oh, little woman, you are so mystifying

You know you're so mystifying
You know you're so mystifying
You know you're so mystifying


Every night I just can't go sleep
Every night I have to count sheep
Every night I just can't go sleep, uh huh

And I want to hold you
But when nighttime comes
You're not around for me to love

Every night I just can't go sleep
Every night I have to count sheep
Every night I just can't go sleep, uh huh
Without you, without you

I wanna lot out of life, but I know my limitations
Guess I want a lot of things and got my inclinations
Got my feet on the ground, and I'm standing on my own
I don't need no one
I don't need no one

I've learned a lot out of life, watchin' other folks mistakes
Funny things that they can get for finding out too late
I got my feet on the ground, and I'm standing on my own
I don't need no one
I don't need no one

Well I don't need nobody else
All I need's a single ticket
When I travel on my own
Not afraid to be alone
I got my feet upon the ground, and I'm standing on my own
When I travel far and wide
And looking for a four leaf clover
Don't mind if I can't find it, got no chip upon my shoulder
Got my feet on the ground, and I'm standing on my own
I don't need no one
I don't need no one

Well I don't need nobody else
All I need's a single ticket
When I travel on my own
Not afraid to be alone
I got my feet upon the ground, and I'm standing on my own
When I travel far and wide
And looking for a four leaf clover
Don't mind if I can't find it, got no chip upon my shoulder
Got my feet on the ground, and I'm standing on my own
I don't need no one
I don't need no one

Met a girl, fell in love, glad as I can be
Met a girl, fell in love, glad as I can be
But I think all the time, is she true to me?
'Cause there's nothing in this world to stop me worrying 'bout that girl

I found out I was wrong, she was just two timing
I found out I was wrong, she just kept on lying
Now she tries to tell the truth, and I just can't believe
'Cause there's nothing in this world to stop me worrying 'bout that girl

Tell me who can I turn to, just who can I believe?
Tried to put her out of my mind, she'll only cause me grief
I love that girl, whatever she's done, you know it hurts me deeply
'Cause there's nothing in this world to stop me worrying 'bout that girl

I know she's been with other fellas, why she keep on lying?
It hurts me so when she says nothing, I really feel like dying
I ache inside every time I think, I know it's just my pride
'Cause there's nothing in this world to stop me worrying 'bout that girl
'Cause there's nothing in this world to stop me worrying 'bout that girl


You know you keep on naggin' babe
Complaining I'm living in sin[?]
The reason you keep on naggin'
Is because you found another man

Baby, you're gonna find another man
All right, for sure...


Well I wonder where my baby is tonight

I wonder where my baby's gone
Hope she'll do no wrong
Lookin' for my baby, she's not around
I wonder where my baby is tonight

I wonder what on Earth's my baby's doin'
If she's not at home there's trouble brewin'
If she really loves me she'll believe in what I say
Tryin' hard to find out where my baby is tonight
If she's not at home I'd better go

Well I only know I wanna see my baby
Went to call for her but she is gone right out of sight
Looking for my baby
She's not around
I wonder where my baby is tonight

Well I wonder where my baby is tonight

I wonder where my baby's gone
Hope she'll do no wrong
Lookin' for my baby, she's not around

I hope that everything's gonna be all right
Well I wonder where my baby is tonight

Don't ever change
Don't ever change from the way that you are now
If you ever change

Let 'em see that you're not losin'
See the clock, it's gettin' late now
Get you coat and fix your face

So come on now (baby come on now)
Well come on now
Well it's getting late and we better go

So long, so long
Now I'm on my way
So long, so long
See you all some day

Don't know where I'm heading for
Turn my back and walk away
Don't think about what's left behind
Otherwise

Think about the good times
Think about the people you love
Think about the sun that is gone
And there ain't no use me talking 'bout the things we used to do

So long, so long
I'm better by myself
So long, so long
Don't need nobody else

If I fade from people's hearts
I'm glad I left them far behind
There's one thing that holds me still
I'm thinkin'

The memory of your kiss
The memory of your sweet caress
The memory of you love that is gone
And there ain't no use me talking 'bout the things we used to do

So long, so long
Got no time for tears
So long, so long
Got music in my ears

Got no time for Muswell town
Gonna look around now
My old town was good to me
But oh...

Guess I'll say so long now
Don't even say a word
I'll turn my back and walk away, but oh...
The day that I've seen everything I promise to return

So long, so long
Now I'm on my way
So long, so long
See you all some day
So long, so long
Now I'm on my way
So long, so long


Can't you see (can't you see)
Can't you see by the look in my eyes
Can't you see (can't you see)
Can't you see I'm in paradise

I feel all right
I feel okay
'Cause I'm in love (I'm in love)
And you shouldn't be sad

People say (people say)
That love can do funny things
But I say (but I say)
I'm gonna take what the future brings

I feel all right
I feel okay
'Cause I'm in love (I'm in love)
And you shouldn't be sad

No, you can't be sad my darling
If you say you love me too
Well, it seems that all the good things I've done
Done it all for you
Done it all, done it all for you

Can't you see (can't you see)
Can't you see by the look in my eyes
Can't you see (can't you see)
Can't you see I'm in paradise

They said this was the last dance
The lights went dim as I looked round the floor
Then I saw you standing there
Then I walked up to you and I asked for this dance

The band had started to play
I held you hand and I sighed
Is this the start of another heart breaker
Or something better beginning
Something better beginning
Something better beginning

I never thought I'd love like this until I met you
I found something I thought I'd never had
The only time I feel all right is when I'm with you
I wonder how long it will last

I walked you home in the night
The moon shone bright as we walked hand in hand
I've known this joy once before
But it came to an end just as it had began

Each step that I took with you
Brought one thing closer to my mind
Is this the start of another heart breaker
Or something better beginning
Something better beginning
Something better beginning


And I know, and I know,
And I know that ev'rybody,
And I know that ev'rybody be happy,

I've been cryin' all the Winter.
I've been waiting for some good to come my way,
But I'll wait till the Summer comes along.
Dear Lord, have I done so much wrong.

How can I go on,
Wondering what I did wrong,
Can it be too much to ask?
Please, oh please, let it be.

If the Summer'll come my way,
Will I find someone to take the place of [?]?
But I'll wait till the Summer comes along.
Dear Lord, tell me what could I've done wrong.

Can it be that she,
Never wanted to,
Break some poor mother's heart?
Please, oh please, let it be.

I know my Summer'll never come.
I know I'll cry until my dying day has come.
Let the Winter roll along.
I've got nothing left but song.

Oh, oh, what's happened?
Oh, oh, what's happened?

The matrimonial stakes.

Don't you fret, now, I'll be there
I'll be there to hold your hand.
I'll be there to see the sunrise,
As it lightens up the sky.

Don't you fret, now, I'll be there,

When I look up from my pillow I dream you are there with me.
Though you are far away I know you'll always be near to me.
I go to sleep, sleep, and imagine that you're there with me.
I go to sleep, sleep, and imagine that you're there with me.

I look around me and feel you are ever so close to me.
Each tear that flows from my eyes brings back memories of you to me.
I go to sleep, sleep, and imagine that you're there with me.
I go to sleep, sleep, and imagine that you're there with me.

I was wrong, I will cry, I will love you to the day I die.
You alone, you alone and no one else, you were meant for me.

When morning comes once more I have the loneliness you left me.
Each day drags by until finally night time descends on me.
I go to sleep, sleep, and imagine that you're there with me.
I go to sleep, sleep, and imagine that you're there with me.


Well I've tried everything to get along with you

'Cause my life has begun
You and me were free
We do as we please, yeah
From morning, till the end of the day
Till the end of the day

You and me were free
We do as we please, yeah
From morning, till the end of the day
Till the end of the day
Till the end of the day
Till the end of the day
Till the end of the day
Till the end of the day


You worry 'bout the sun
What's the use of worrying 'bout the big ol' sun
You worry 'bout the rain
The rain keeps falling just the same
You worry when the one you need has found somebody new

But the world keeps going round
The world keeps going round
You just can't stop it
The world keeps going round

You worry 'bout yourself
What's the use of worrying now you're almost grown
You worry 'bout your own
What's the use of worrying 'cause you'll die alone
Times will be hard, rain will fall
And you'll feel mighty low

But the world keeps going round
The world keeps going round
You just can't stop it
The world keeps going round

Times will be hard, rain will fall
And you'll feel mighty low

But the world keeps going round
The world keeps going round
The world keeps going round
The world keeps going round
You just can't stop it
The world keeps going round
The world keeps going round


I'm on an island
And I've got no where to swim
Oh what a mood I am in
I'm on an island

I'm on an island
Since my girl left me behind
She said that I'm not her kind
I'm on an island

But there is no where else on Earth I'd rather be
Then if my long, lost little girl was here with me

I'm on an island
And I've got no where to run
Because I'm the only one
Who's on the island

But there is no where else on Earth I'd rather be
Then if my long, lost little girl was here with me
I'm on an island
And I've got no where to run
Because I'm the only one
Who's on this island

I'm on an island
I'm on an island


Well, lived my life and never stopped to worry 'bout a thing
Opened up and shouted out and never tried to sing
Wondering if I'd done wrong
Will this depression last for long?

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

Well, once we had an easy ride and always felt the same
Time was on our side and I had everything to gain
Let it be like yesterday
Please let me have happy days

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

Ma and Pa look back at all the things they used to do
Didn't have no money and they always told the truth
Daddy didn't have no toys
And mummy didn't need no boys

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

Well, yesterday was such an easy game for you to play
But let's face it things are so much easier today
Guess you need some bringing down
And get your feet back on the ground

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?


It's too late now for you to say your sorry
It's too late now for you to make amends
You're gonna pay for all the lies you told me
Well don't apologize 'cause it's too late

It's too late
Much too late
You said those words
You said them much too late

It's too late
Much too late
You said those words
You said them much too late

It's too late now for you to sympathize, dear
The wheel of time is grinding 'gainst your dreams
I really wouldn't want to cause no pain now
You said those words, you said them much too late

It's too late
Much too late
You said those words
You said them much too late


I wanna know what is to be
To see what life's cut out for me
I'm waiting for my fate
'Cause I know I've done wrong
I wanna know just what's in store for me

I wish I had a crystal ball
To see my rise and see my fall
I've done a lot of right,
But also done some wrong
I wanna know just what's in store for me

And so I'll wait a while
And wait a little longer
I'll just have to wait and see

I think a lot but I'll stop trying
I'll just get old before my time
I'll live the life I've got
But I don't sleep at night
I wanna know just what's in store for me

I'll live the life I've got
But I don't sleep at night
I wanna know just what's in store for me
I wanna know just what's in store for me


You'll try and you'll try again
But you know you can't win
You'll try and you'll try again
But you know you can't win

What more can I say now?
What more can I do?
No need to feel sad now
'Cause times are pretty thin
And you can't win
You can't win
You can't win

Try and do what you can
But you know you can't win
You say you don't understand
But you know you can't win

What more can you say now?
What more can you do?
No need to feel sad now
'Cause times are pretty thin
And you can't win
You can't win
You can't win

What more can I say now?
What more can I do?
No need to feel sad now
'Cause times are pretty thin
You can't win
You can't win
You can't win


They seek him here, they seek him there,
His clothes are loud, but never square.
It will make or break him so he's got to buy the best,
'Cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion.

And when he does his little rounds,
'Round the boutiques of London Town,
Eagerly pursuing all the latest fads and trends,
'Cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion.

Oh yes he is (oh yes he is), oh yes he is (oh yes he is).
He thinks he is a flower to be looked at,
And when he pulls his frilly nylon panties right up tight,
He feels a dedicated follower of fashion.

Oh yes he is (oh yes he is), oh yes he is (oh yes he is).
There's one thing that he loves and that is flattery.
One week he's in polka-dots, the next week he is in stripes.
'Cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion.

They seek him here, they seek him there,
In Regent Street and Leicester Square.
Everywhere the Carnabetian army marches on,
Each one an dedicated follower of fashion.

Oh yes he is (oh yes he is), oh yes he is (oh yes he is).
His world is built 'round discoteques and parties.
This pleasure-seeking individual always looks his best
'Cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion.

Oh yes he is (oh yes he is), oh yes he is (oh yes he is).
He flits from shop to shop just like a butterfly.
In matters of the cloth he is as fickle as can be,
'Cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion.
He's a dedicated follower of fashion.
He's a dedicated follower of fashion.

I'm on a party line,
Wonderin' all the time,
Who's on the other end?
Is she big, is she small?
Is she a she at all?
Who's on my party line?

The person who is on my party line.

Rosy won't you please come home?
Mama don't know where you've been.
Rosy won't you please come home?
Your room's clean and no one's in it.

Oh my Rosy, how I miss you,
You are all the world to me.
Take a look and see if you like it,
If you like it please come back.

Rosy won't you please come home?
Since you've joined the upper classes,
You don't know us anymore.
Live and let your troubles pass.

Rosy, Rosy, will you write and tell me,
If you don't want to come back?
I would sacrifice all I have
To have a happy home once more.

Rosy won't you please come home?
Two long years have passed away.
Since you tried to change your life,
Christmas wasn't quite the same.

Rosy, Rosy, got any answers?
You are miles across the sea,
And I'll bake a cake if you tell me
You are on the first plane home.

Rosy won't you please come home?
Mama don't know where you've been.

Dandy, Dandy,
Where you gonna go now?
Who you gonna run to?
All your little life
You're chasing all the girls.
They can't resist your smile.
Oh, they long for Dandy, Dandy.

Checkin' out the ladies,
Tickling their fancy,
Pouring out your charm
To meet your own demands,
And turn it off at will.
Oh, they long for Dandy, Dandy.

Knockin' on the back door,
Climbing through the window,
Hubby's gone away,
And while the cat's away
The mice are gonna play.
Oh, you low down Dandy, Dandy.
Dandy

Dandy, you know you're moving much too fast,
And Dandy, you know you can't escape the past.
Look around you and see the people settle down,
And when you're old and grey you will remember what they said,
That two girls are too many, three's a crowd and four you're dead.

Oh Dandy, Dandy,
When you gonna give up?
Are you feeling old now?
You always will be free,
You need no sympathy,
A bachelor you will stay,
And Dandy, you're all right.
You're all right.
You're all right.
You're all right.
You're all right.
You're all right.


There's too much on my mind,
There's too much on my mind,
And I can't sleep at night thinking about it.
I'm thinking all the time,
There's too much on my mind,
It seems there's more to life than just to live it.

There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can say.
There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can do
About it,
About it.

My thought just weigh me down,
And drag me to the ground,
And shake my head till there's no more life in me.
It's ruining my brain,
I'll never be the same,
My poor demented mind is slowly going.

There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can say.
There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can do
About it,
About it.

There's too much on my mind.


He never will forget at all
The day he played at the Albert Hall.
A million sessions ago it seems.
He is a session man,
A chord progression,
A top musician.

Rock 'n' roll or vocal star[?],
A philharmonic orchestra,
Everything comes the same to him.
He is a session man,
A chord progression,
A top musician.

He's not paid to think, just play,
A session man
A session man
A session man
Playing at a different studio every day.

He reads the dots and plays each line,
And always finishes on time.
No overtime nor favors done.
He is a session man,
A chord progression,
A top musician.

He's not paid to think, just play,
A session man
A session man

A misty shadow spread its wings
And covered all the ground
And even though the sun was out
The rain came pouring down

And all the light had disappeared
And faded in the gloom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

The eagle spread its mighty wings
And pounced upon its pray
And all the skies, so brilliant blue
Turned suddenly to grey

The cherished things are perishing
And buried in their tomb
There is no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

The demon stretched its crinkled hand
And snatched a butterfly
The elves and gnomes were hunched in fear
Too terrified to cry

The reckoning was beckoning
They're living to their doom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain


He don't need no sedatives to ease his troubled mind.
At work he is invariably unpleasant and unkind.
Why should he care if he is hated in his home,
'Cause he's gotta house in the country,
And a big sports car.
He's gotta house in the country,
And a big sports car.

But he ain't gotta home, oh no,
And he's as wicked as he can be,
'Cause he's gotta house in the country
Where he likes to spend his weekend days.
Oh yeah, oh yeah, well all right

Well, he got his job when drunken Daddy tumbled down the stairs.
From that very day this boy is more than having his share.
One of these days I'm gonna knock him off of his throne,
'Cause he's gotta house in the country,
And a big sports car.
He's gotta house in the country,
And a big sports car.

And he's oh so smug, oh yeah.

I won a competition in a little column in my local paper.
So I packed my bags and flew across the sea all on my local paper.
I sailed to Hawaii in the U.S.A.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.

I didn't realize it was commercialized when I unpacked my cases,
Because a genuine Hawaii ukulele cost me 30 guineas,
And even when I'm swimming I have to pay.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.
Oh yeah, yeah.

Across the coral sands I saw a hula hula dancer, looking pretty.
I asked her where she came from and she said to me,
"I come from New York City,
And my mother is Italian,
And my dad's a Greek."
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.

It's a hooka hooka on the shiny briny on the way to Kona[?],
And in a little shack they had a little sign that said Coca Cola,
And even all the grass skirts were PVC.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.
Oh yeah, yeah.

In Waikiki

It was the biggest house in the neighborhood.
He went and bought this house when he made good.
Ten bedrooms and a swimming pool,
Where he entertained all the people that he knew.
But he hit the hard times and had to sell out.
Most exclusive residence for sale.

He went and spent all the money that he had.
Because he had a heart and not a head.
He spent it all on girls and fancy jewelry.
Then he found himself in front of a judge and jury,
And the judge said to pay up, our you must sell out.
Most exclusive residence for sale.

He had to tell all the servants to go away.
Couldn't even afford to pay their way.
He took to the bottle and drunk himself down,
Then he soaked away all the troubles and let them drown.
Then he saw a notice on the wall,
Most exclusive residence for sale.
Most exclusive residence for sale.
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la


Fancy, if you believe in what I believe in,
Then we'll be the same, always.
Fancy, just look around thee
If you will fancy all the girls you see, always.

My love is like a ruby that no one can see,
Only my fancy, always.
No one can penetrate me,
They only see what's in their own fancy, always.


Well I met her accidentally,
In a little discotheque.
And she acted oh so friendly
To every fella that she met.
And her hair was hanging down,
Like a bright and silken sheen.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing night and day.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.

Although she looked so happy,
There was sadness in her eyes.
And her curly false eyelashes
Weren't much of a disguise.
And her bright and golden hair,
Was not all that it might seem.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dances sadly on.
Yes Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.

There was something missing
From her carefree little life,
And she'll never understand you
When you're kissing her good night.
'Cause the only boy she had
Went and coolly stepped aside.
And Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Might as well have died.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.


When I first saw her
She looked alright,
Second time that I saw her
She looked outta sight.
And I said,
You're lookin' fine,
You're lookin' fine,
You're lookin' fine,
And I feel alright,
Yes, I feel alright.

She got all the angles,
So directly applied.
And when I see her,
I have to cry,
You're lookin' fine,
You're lookin' fine,
You're lookin' fine,
And I feel alright,
Yeah, I feel alright.

You're lookin' fine,
You're lookin' fine,
You're lookin' fine,
And I feel alright,
And I feel alright.


The tax man's taken all my dough
And left me in my stately home
Lazing on a sunny afternoon
And I can't sail my yacht
He's taken everything I've got
All I've got's this sunny afternoon

Save me, save me, save me from this squeeze
I got a big fat mama trying to break me
And I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazing on a sunny afternoon
In the summertime
In the summertime
In the summertime

My girlfriend's run off with my car
And gone back to her ma and pa
Telling tales of drunkenness and cruelty
Now I'm sitting here
Sipping at my ice cold beer
Lazing on a sunny afternoon

Help me, help me, help me sail away
Well give me two good reasons why I oughta stay
'Cause I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazing on a sunny afternoon
In the summertime
In the summertime

I won't take all that they hand me down,
And make out a smile, though I wear a frown,
And I won't take it all lying down,

There's a crack up in the ceiling,
And the kitchen sink is leaking.
Out of work and got no money,
A Sunday joint of bread and honey.

Two-roomed apartment on the second floor.

Boil the tea and put some toast on.

She was sick and tired of country life.
A little country home,
A little country folk,
Made her blood run cold.
Now her mother pines her heart away,
Looking for her child in the big black smoke,
In the big black smoke.

Frailest, purest girl the world has seen,
According to her Ma, according to her Pa,
And everybody said,
That she knew no sin and did no wrong,
Till she walked the streets of the big black smoke,
Of the big black smoke.

Well, she slept in caffs and coffee bars and bowling alleys,
And every penny she had
Was spent on purple hearts and cigarettes.

She took all her pretty coloured clothes,
And ran away from home
And the boy next door,
For a boy named Joe.
And he took her money for the rent
And tried to drag her down in the big black smoke,
In the big black smoke.

In the big black smoke.
In the big black smoke.


Oh Mr. Pleasant, how is Mrs Pleasant?
I hope the world is treating you right,
And your head's in the air,
And you're feeling so proud,
'Cause you're such a success,
And the whole wide world is on your side, hey hey.
How are you today?

People say Mr. Pleasant is good,
Mr. Pleasant is kind,
Mr. Pleasant's okay,
Mr. Pleasant don't mind.
As long as Mr. Pleasant's all right, hey hey.
How are you today?

How's your father, how's your mother?
How's your sister, how's your brother?
How's your brand, new limousine,
Twenty-four inch TV screen?
Did you like prosperity
More than you liked poverty?
Life is easier, so much easier,
Life is easier now.

Oh Mr. Pleasant, how is Mrs Pleasant?
Did you know she was flirting around
With another young man,
And he's taking her out
When you have to work late?
And it's not so pleasant after all, hey hey.
How are you today?

I can't think of a place I'd rather be.
The whole wide world doesn't mean so much to me,
For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.

Tell me now if you want me to stay.
It don't matter, 'cause I'd stay here anyway.
For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.

Well, I ain't gonna wander,
Like the boy I used to know.
He's a real unluckly fella,
And he's got no place to go.

I won't search for a house upon a hill.
Why should I when I'd only miss you still,
For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.
This is where I belong.


Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
I'll believe all that you put down.
I'll believe the sun is going up,
Even though it's going down.

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
Don't you twist my words around.
I'll kill you, I won't let you,
Distort my simple sound.

Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Did your daddy stop you playing
With your friends when you were young?
And is that why you run down
All the young folks have their fun. [?]

The reason I am stupid,
Is because I read you every day.
You misquote all of the true things
Because they rub you the wrong way.

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

I am a dull and simple lad
Can not tell water from champagne
And I have never met the queen
And I wish I could have all that he has got
I wish I could be like David Watts

Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa

And when I lie on my pillow at night
I dream I could fight like David Watts
Lead the school team to victory
And take my exams and pass the lot

(Wish I could be)
Wish I could be like David Watts
(Wish I could be)
Wish I could be like David Watts
(Wish I could be)
Conduct my life like David Watts
(Wish I could be)
I wish I could be like David Watts

Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa

He is the head boy at the school
He is the captain of the team
He is so gay and fancy free
And I wish all his money belonged to me
I wish I could be like David Watts

Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa

And all the girls in the neighborhood
Try to go out with David Watts
They try their best but can't succeed
For he is of pure and noble breed

Wish I could be like
Wish I could be like
Wish I could be like

Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa

My makeup is dry and it clags on my chin
I'm drowning my sorrows in whisky and gin
The lion tamer's whip doesn't crack anymore
The lions they won't fight and the tigers won't roar

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
So let's all drink to the death of a clown
Won't someone help me to break up this crown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown

The old fortune teller lies dead on the floor
Nobody needs fortunes told anymore
The trainer of insects is crouched on his knees
And frantically looking for runaway fleas

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
So won't someone help me to break up this crown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la


Sylvilla looked into her mirror
Percilla looked into the washing machine
And the drudgery of being wed
She was so jealous of her sister
And her liberty, and her smart young friends
She was so jealous of her sister

Sylvilla looked into the wardrobe
Percilla looked into the frying pan
And the bacon and eggs
And the breakfast is served
She was so jealous of her sister
And her way of life, and her luxury flat
She was so jealous of her sister

She threw away her dirty dishes just to be free again
Her women's weekly magazines just to be free again
And put the children in the nursery just to be free again
Percilla saw her little children
And then decided she was better off
Than the wayward lass that her sister had been
No longer jealous of her sister
So she ran 'round the house with her curlers on
No longer jealous of her sister


If, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return

Stars would shine no more
I would walk up and down this lonely room
I would have friends, but be alone
For there is no return

For you were my first love
And now it looks like you've gone
And I have waited too long

For if, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return
There is no return


Ah, Tom is young and Tom is bold
Tom is as bold as the knights of old
But whenever he gets in a bit of a jam
There's nothing he won't do to get a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And he curses himself for the life he's led
And rolls himself a harry rag and puts himself to bed

Ah, Tom's old ma is a dying lass
Soon they all reckon she'll be pushing up the grass
And her bones might ache and her skin might sag
But still she's got the strength to have a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And she curses herself for the life she's led
And rolls herself a harry rag and puts herself to bed

Ah, bless you tax man, bless you all
You may take some but you never take it all
But if I give it all, I won't feel sad
As long as I got enough to buy a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And I curse myself for the life I've led
And roll myself a harry rag and put myself to bed

Ah, the smart young ladies of the land
Can't relax without a harry in their hand
And they light one and they boast and brag
So content because they got a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And they'll light one and they'll boast and brag
So content because they got a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
I'll do anything just to get a harry rag
And I curse myself for the life I've led
And roll myself a harry rag and put myself to bed


Just a quiet city sport[?]
With a wife and little kids to support
So immaculately dressed when he walks
Like a soldier on parade

He's a tin soldier man
Living in a little tin wonderland
Very happy little tin soldier man
When you set him on your knee

Every day you see his army march down the street
Changing guards at the high road

He's a tin soldier man

Wickie wa-waddle doo[?]
And he's got a little tin lady too
Just to put a little shine on his shoes
And keep his uniform tidy

He's a tin soldier man

Wickie wa-waddle doo[?]
And he's got a little tin lady too
Just to put a little shine on his shoes
And make his uniform tidy

He's a tin soldier man
Living in a little tin wonderland
Very happy little tin soldier man
When you sit him on your knee

He's a tin soldier man
He's a tin soldier man


Suzy and Johnny were happy
Earned enough to pay the rent
But Johnny's mother-in-law had too much ambition
And this made Johnny very upset
So to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Johnny gave up his position
Just to please his mother-in-law
So he left the job where he'd been all his life
He left and turned his back on door[?]

Now he's looking at the situations vacant
Situations vacant
Just to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Then he had to leave the apartment
And sought a less plush residence
And poor Suzy and Johnny had to skimp and save
Just to help to pay the weekly rent

So to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Johnny's got no money
Got no where to go
Johnny's in a great big hole
Suzy's separated, living with her ma
Now little mama's satisfied


You don't have to look at me
You don't have to smile at me
You just have to love me till the sun shines
You don't have to cook for me
You don't have to laugh with me
You just have to love me till the sun shines

Take my money, I don't mind
You can be such a helpless kind[?]
You just have to love me till the sun shines

You don't have to sleep with me
Or rest your head upon my knee
You just have to love me till the sun shines
Baby you can wear my clothes,
Play my records, stay at my home
Long as you just love me till the sun shines

You can take it, I don't mind
Please don't be such a helpless kind
You just have to love me till the sun shines

Baby, baby I don't know what I'm doing
Everything I do it turns to ruin[?]

Baby you can kiss my friends
Baby there's nothing that I'll end[?]
Long as you just love me till the sun shines
You don't have to walk the streets
When there's someone waiting here
Come on, baby, love me till the sun shines

Come on, baby, I don't mind
Two lonely people, the helpless kind[?]
Come on, baby, love me till the sun shines

You don't have to look at me
You don't have to smile at me
You just have to love me till the sun shines
You don't have to cook for me
You don't have to laugh with me
You just have to love me till the sun shines

Take my money, I don't mind
You can be such a helpless kind[?]
You just have to love me till the sun shines


Lazy old sun
What have you done to summertime?
Hiding away
Behind all those misty thunder clouds
I don't mind
To spend my time
Looking for you
For you are my one reality
When I'm dead and gone
Your light will shine eternally
Sunny rain, shine my way
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun

You make the rainbows and you make the night disappear
You melt the frost so I won't criticize my sun

When I was young
My world was three foot, seven inch tall
When you were young
There was no world at all
Sunny rain, shine my way
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun

Lazy old sun
Lazy old sun
Lazy old sun


Tea time won't be the same without my Donna
At night I lie awake and dream of Donna
I think about that small cafe
That's where we used to meet each day
And then we used to sit a while
And drink our afternoon tea

I'll take afternoon tea (afternoon tea)
If you take it with me (afternoon tea)
You take as long as you like
'Cause I like you, girl

I take sugar with tea (afternoon tea)
You take milk if you please (afternoon tea)
Like you talking to me
Because you ease my mind

Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba (afternoon tea)
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba (afternoon tea)
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba (afternoon tea)
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba (afternoon tea)

Tea time still ain't the same without my Donna
At night I lie awake and dream of Donna
I went to our cafe one day
They said that Donna walked away
You'd think at least she might have stayed
To drink her afternoon tea

I'll take afternoon tea (afternoon tea)
If you take it with me (afternoon tea)
You take as long as you like
'Cause I like you, girl

I take afternoon tea (afternoon tea)
Every day of the week (afternoon tea)
Please come along if you like
Because I like you, girl

Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba (afternoon tea)
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba (afternoon tea)


You're walking 'round in my memory
That only gets stronger and stronger
Smudged mascara and pill-shaped eyes
Everything you want was bought with lies.

But what can I do about it
The say you won't last any longer
All the gates of love you won't walk through
The only gates you see are colored blue.

I see you peering through frosted windows
Eyes don't smile, all they do is cry
Funny Face, she's all right
Funny Face, she's all right
Funny Face, she's all right

Oh how can I live without her
The doctors won't let me see her
But I can catch a glimpse through the doorway
Of the girl that I love and care for

I see you peering through frosted windows
Eyes don't smile, all they do is cry
Funny Face, she's all right
Funny Face, she's all right
Funny Face, she's all right


Winter time is coming
All the sky is grey
Summer birds aren't singing
Since you went away

Since you've been gone, end of the season
Winter is here, close of play
I get no kicks walking down Saville Row
There's no more chicks left where the green grass grows and I know that
Winter is here, end of the season
My reason's gone, close of play
I just can't mix in all the clubs I know
Now Labour's in, I have no place to go

You're on a yacht near an island in Greece
Though you are hot, forget me not
I will keep waiting until your return
Now you are gone, end of the season
Winter will come any day
Back in the scrum on a wet afternoon
Down in the mud, dreaming of flowers in June
End of the season
End of the season


Dirty old river, must you keep rolling
Flowing into the night
People so busy, makes me feel dizzy
Taxi light shines so bright
But I don't need no friends
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise

Every day I look at the world from my window
But chilly, chilly is the evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine

Terry meets Julie, Waterloo Station
Every Friday night
But I am so lazy, don't want to wander
I stay at home at night
But I don't feel afraid
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise

Every day I look at the world from my window
But chilly, chilly is the evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine

Millions of people swarming like flies 'round Waterloo underground
But Terry and Julie cross over the river
Where they feel safe and sound
And they don't need no friends
As long as they gaze on Waterloo sunset
They are in paradise

Waterloo sunset's fine


You don't need no fancy clothes
Where'd you get them, goodness knows?
Just show some civility.
Act nice, act nice and gentle to me.

I don't need no luxuries,
As long as you are understanding,
I'm not difficult to please.
Act nice, act nice and gentle to me.

Well I'm the kind of guy who likes
To take you as I find you
So throw away those false eyelashes and,
Act nice, act nice, baby.

Come on baby, hold my hand.
Come on baby, understand, you gotta
Act nice, act nice and gentle to me.
Act nice, act nice and gentle to me.

Come on baby, hold my hand.
Come on baby, understand, you gotta
Act nice, act nice and gentle to me.
Act nice, act nice and gentle to me.


From the dew-soaked hedge creeps a crawly caterpillar,
When the dawn begins to crack.
It's all part of my autumn almanac.
Breeze blows leaves of a musty-coloured yellow,
So I sweep them in my sack.
Yes, yes, yes, it's my autumn almanac.

Friday evenings, people get together,
Hiding from the weather.
Tea and toasted, buttered currant buns
Can't compensate for lack of sun,
Because the summer's all gone.

La-la-la-la...
Oh, my poor rheumatic back
Yes, yes, yes, it's my autumn almanac.
La-la-la-la...
Oh, my autumn almanac
Yes, yes, yes, it's my autumn almanac.

I like my football on a Saturday,
Roast beef on Sundays, all right.
I go to Blackpool for my holidays,
Sit in the open sunlight.

This is my street, and I'm never gonna to leave it,
And I'm always gonna to stay here
If I live to be ninety-nine,
'Cause all the people I meet
Seem to come from my street
And I can't get away,
Because it's calling me, (come on home)
Hear it calling me, (come on home)

La-la-la-la...
Oh, my autumn Armagnac
Yes, yes, yes, it's my autumn almanac.
La-la-la-la...
Oh, my autumn almanac
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

Bop-bop-bopm-bop-bop, whoa!
Bop-bop-bopm-bop-bop, whoa!

Oh, Suzannah's bedraggled but she
Still wears the locket 'round her neck.
She's got a picture on the table
Of a man who is young and able.

Oh, Suzannah's gonna cry,
Oh, Suzannah's still alive.
Whiskey or gin, that's alright,
When there's nothing in her bed at night
She sleeps with the covers down,
Hopin' that somebody gets in.
Doesn't matter what she does,
She knows that she can't win.
Oh, Suzannah's gonna cry.

She's got a doll with one eye,
That always cries when she gets some sleep
She's waiting for a soldier to come home,
But she'll cry and never die.

Oh, Suzannah's gonna cry,
Oh, Suzannah's still alive.
Whiskey or gin, that's alright,
When there's nothing in her bed at night
She sleeps with the covers down,
Hopin' that somebody gets in.
Doesn't matter what she does,
She knows that she can't win.
Oh, Suzannah's still alive.

Oh, Suzannah's gonna cry,
Oh, Suzannah's still alive.
Oh, Suzannah's still alive.

Wonder boy, life's just begun.
Turn your sorrow into wonder
Dream alone, don't sigh, don't groan
Life is only what you wonder.
Day is as light as your brightest dreams,
Night is as dark as you feel it ought to be.
Time is as fast as the slowest thing,
Life is only...

Wonder boy,
Wonder boy.
Everybody is looking for the sun.
People strain their eyes to see,
But I see you and you see me,
And ain't that wonder?

Wonder boy, some mother's son,
Life is full of work and plunder[blunder?].
Easy go, life is not real,
Life is only what you conjure.

Wonder boy,
And the world is joy, every single day.
It's the real McCoy,
Wonder boy.
Everybody is looking for the sun.
People strain their eyes to see,
But I see you and you see me,
And ain't that wonder?

Wonder boy, some mother's son,
Turn your sorrow into wonder
Dream alone, go have your fun.
Life is only...
Life is only...
Life is only...


Polly wouldn't listen to her Mama,
Polly wouldn't listen to her Papa.
She tried to make the swinging city scene,
And now there's not a place that Polly hasn't been.

Polly, pretty pretty Pollyanna,
Pretty pretty Pollyanna,
Pretty Polly Garter
Oh, I think that pretty Polly should have stayed at home.

Pretty Polly, dressed as jolly as can be,
She's so darling, all the fellas do agree,
And half a million people can't be wrong,
Oh, I think that pretty Polly should have stayed at home.

Polly wrote a letter to her Mama,
Polly made confessions to her Papa.
Mummy's proud 'cause Polly's still in chains
She's happy now her baby's coming home again.

Pretty Polly, she learned that life is just a game,
She is sorry, she just had to break the chains.
And Mama knows, 'cause Mama was the same
Oh, she's happy now her baby's coming home again.

Polly, pretty pretty Pollyanna,
Pretty pretty pretty pretty Pollyanna,
Pretty Polly Garter
Oh, Polly, pretty pretty Pollyanna,
Pretty pretty pretty pretty Pollyanna,
Pretty Polly Garter
I think that pretty Polly should have stayed at home.

Walter, remember when the world was young
And all the girls knew Walter's name?
Walter, isn't it a shame the way our little world has changed?
Do you remember, Walter, playing cricket in the thunder and the rain?
Do you remember, Walter, smoking cigarettes behind your garden gate?
Yes, Walter was my mate,
But Walter, my old friend, where are you now?

Walter's name.
Walter, isn't it a shame the way our little world has changed?
Do you remember, Walter, how we said we'd fight the world so we'd be free.
We'd save up all our money and we'd buy a boat and sail away to sea.
But it was not to be.
I knew you then but do I know you now?

Walter, you are just an echo of a world I knew so long ago
If you saw me now you wouldn't even know my name.
I bet you're fat and married and you're always home in bed by half-past eight.
And if I talked about the old times you'd get bored and you'll have nothing more to say.
Yes people often change, but memories of people can remain.


Picture yourself when you're getting old,
Sat by the fireside a-pondering on[?].
Picture book, pictures of your mama, taken by your papa a long time ago.
Picture book, of people with each other, to prove they love each other a long ago.
Na, na, na, na, na na.
Na, na, na, na, na na.

A picture of you in your birthday suit,
You sat in the sun on a hot afternoon.
Picture book, your mama and your papa, and fat old Uncle Charlie out boozing with their friends.
Picture book, a holiday in August, outside a bed and breakfast in sunny Southend.
Picture book, when you were just a baby, those days when you were happy, a long time ago.
Na, na, na, na, na na.

Johnny Thunder lives on water, feeds on lightning.
Johnny Thunder don't need no one, don't want money.
And all the people of the town,
They can't get through to Johnny, they will never, ever break him down.
Johnny Thunder speaks for no one, goes on fighting.
And sweet Helena in bed[?] prays for Johnny.

Ba ba-ba ba ba-ba ba,
Ba ba-ba ba ba-ba ba,
Thunder and lightning.
Ba ba-ba ba ba-ba ba,
Ba ba-ba ba ba-ba ba,
Thunder and lightning.

Though everybody tried their best,
Old Johnny vowed that he would never, ever end up like the rest.
Johnny Thunder rides the highway, moves like lightning.
But sweet Helena just says, "God bless Johnny."

Ba ba-ba ba ba-ba ba,
Ba ba-ba ba ba-ba ba,
Thunder and lightning.
Ba ba-ba ba ba-ba ba,

Like the last of the good ol' puffer trains,
I'm the last of the blood and sweat brigade,
And I don't know where I'm going, or why I came.
I'm the last of the good old fashioned steam-powered trains.

I'm the last of the good old renegades.
All my friends are all middle class and grey,
But I live in a museum, so I'm okay.
I'm the last of the good old fashioned steam-powered trains.

Like the last of the good ol' choo-choo trains,
Huff and puff 'till I blow this world away,
And I'm gonna keep on rollin' till my dying day.
I'm the last of the good old fashioned steam-powered trains.

Like the last of the good ol' puffer trains,
I'm the last of the soot and scum[?] brigade,
And all this peaceful living is drivin' me insane.
I'm the last of the good old fashioned steam-powered trains.
I'm the last of the good old fashioned steam-powered trains.


Big Sky looked down on all the people looking up at the Big Sky.
Everybody pushing one another around
Big Sky feels sad when he sees the children scream and cry
But the Big Sky's too big to let it get him down.

Big Sky too big to cry
Big Sky too high to see
People like you and me

One day we'll be free, we won't care, just you see
'Til that day can be, don't let it get you down
When I feel that the world is too much for me
I think of the Big Sky, and nothing matters much to me.

Big Sky looked down on all the people who think they got problems
They get depressed and they hold their head in their hands and cry.
People lift up their hands and they look up to the Big Sky
But Big Sky is too big to sympathize

Big Sky's too occupied
Though he would like to try
And he feels bad inside
Big Sky's too big to cry

One day we'll be free, we won't care, just you wait and see
'Til that day can be, don't let it get you down.
When I feel that the world is too much for me
I think of the Big Sky, and nothing matters much to me.


Just sitting down by the riverside,
Spreading my arms to the open wide.
Now I am free and the world's at my feet.
I can close my eyes.

Oh Love, keep me warm, keep me satisfied.
Please keep me calm, keep me pacified.
Now I'm content and my life is complete.
I can close my eyes.

Sitting by the riverside with you.

I love sitting down by the riverside,
Watching the water go flowing by.
Oh, golly gee, it is heaven to be
Like a willow tree.

Spend my time just drinking wine while looking at the view.


This world is big and wild and half insane
Take me where real animals are playing
Just a dirty old shack
Where the hound dogs bark
That we called our home
I want to be back there
Among the cats and dogs
And the pigs and the goats
On Animal Farm
My animal home
On Animal Farm
My animal home

While I lay my head upon my pillow
Little girl, come play beneath my window
Though she's far from home
She is free from harm
And she need not fear
She is by my side
And the sky is wide
So let the sun shine bright
On Animal Farm
My animal home
On Animal Farm
My animal home

Girl, It's a hard, hard world, if it gets you down
Dreams often fade and die in a bad, bad world
I'll take you where real animals are playing
And people are real people not just playing
It's a quiet, quiet life
By a dirty old shack
That we called our home
I want to be back there
Among the cats and dogs
And the pigs and the goats
On Animal Farm
My animal home
On Animal Farm
My animal home
On Animal Farm
Animal Farm


Out in the country,
Far from all the soot and noise of the city,
There's a village green.
It's been a long time
Since I last set eyes on the church with the steeple
Down by the village green.
'Twas there I met a girl called Daisy
And kissed her by the old oak tree.
Although I loved my Daisy, I saw fame,
And so I left the village green.

I miss the village green,
And all the simple people.
I miss the village green,
The church, the clock, the steeple.
I miss the morning dew, fresh air and Sunday school.

And now all the houses
Are rare antiquities.
American tourists flock to see the village green.
They snap their photographs and say "Gawd darn it,
Isn't it a pretty scene?"
And Daisy's married Tom the grocer boy,
And now he owns a grocery.

I miss the village green,
And all the simple people.
I miss the village green,
The church, the clock, the steeple.
I miss the morning dew, fresh air and Sunday school.

And I will return there,
And I'll and Daisy,
And we'll sip tea, laugh,
And talk about the village green.
We will laugh and talk about the village green.


Baby, you don't know what you're saying,
Because you're a victim of bright city lights,
And your mind is not right.
You think the world's at your feet.

'Cause you're starstruck, baby, starstruck.
Taken in by the lights,
Think you'll never look back,
You know you're starstruck on me.

Baby, you're running around like you're crazy.
You go to a party and dance through the night,
And you'll drink 'till you're tight,
And then you're out on your feet.

'Cause you're starstruck, baby, starstruck.
Taken in by the lights,
Think you'll never look back,
You know you're starstruck on me.

Baby, watch out or else you'll be ruined,
'Cause once you're addicted to wine and champagne,
It's gonna drive you insane,
Because the world's not so tame.

And you're starstruck, baby, starstruck.
You're taken in by the lights,
Think you'll never look back,
You know you're starstruck on me.
Don't you know that you are,
Starstruck on me.
And you always will be,
Starstruck on me.
Starstruck on me.


A long, long time ago,
In the land of idiot boys,
There live a cat, a phenomenal cat,
Who loved to wallow all day.

No one bothered him
As he sat, content in his tree.
He just lived to eat 'cause it kept him fat,
And that's how he wanted to stay.

Though he was big and fat,
All the world was good to him,
And he pointed out on the map
All the places he had been.
[Cowes, Cathage,Karthom,Cannes?], [India,Sardinia?], Kathmandu,
The Scilley Isles and Sahara, too

Fum, fum, diddle-um di
La la la la, la-la la la
La la la la, la-la la la la
La la la la-la la la

Once when he was thin
He had flown to old Hong Kong,
And had learned the secret of life,
And the sea and the sky beyond.
So he gave up his diet and sat in a tree,
And ate himself through eternity.

Fum, fum, diddle-um di
La la la la la-la la la
La la la la, la-la la la la
La la la la-la la la
Fum, fum, diddle-um di
Fum, fum, diddle-um di


My big day, it was the biggest day of my life.
It was the summit of my long career,
But I felt so down, and I drank too much beer,
The management said that I shouldn't appear.
I walked out onto the stage and started to speak.
The first night I've missed for a couple of years,
I explained to the crowed and they started to jeer,
And just when I wanted no one to be there,
All of my friends were there.
Not just my friends, but their best friends too.
All of my friends were there to stand and stare,
Say what they may, all of their friends need not stay.
Those who laughed were not friends anyway.
All of my friends were there to stand and stare.

Days went by, I walked around dressed in a disguise.
I wore a mustache and I parted my hair,
And gave the impression that I did not care,
But oh, the embarrassment, oh, the dispair.
Came the day, helped with a few large glasses of gin,
I nervously mounted the stage once again,
Got through my performance and no one complained,
Thank God I can go back to normal again.
I went to that old cafe,
Where I had been in much happier days,
And all of my friends were there,
And no one cared.
Say what they may, all of my friends were there.
Not just my friends, but their best friends too.
All of my friends were there,
Now I don't care.


In a dark and misty house
Where no Christian man has been
Wicked Annabella mixes a brew
That no one's ever seen

Relatives have passed her by
Too scared to even say hello
She's in perpetual midnight
She shuts out the day
And goes about her sinful ways

I, I've seen her hair, I've seen her face
Look towards mine
I, I've felt her eyes burning my soul
Twisting my mind

Little children who are good
Should always go to sleep at night
'Cause Wicked Annabella is up in the sky
Hopin' they will open their eyes

Don't go into woods tonight
'Cause underneath the sticks and stones
Are lots of little demons enslaved by Annabella
Waiting just to carry you home


Under a lamp light
Monica stands at midnight,
And every guy think he can buy her love,
But money can't buy sweet lovin' from Monica.

Morning to moonshine,
Monica knows every line.
Don't ever propose 'cause Monica knows, you know.
She'll turn up her nose and say what a fool you are.

I, I shall die,
I, I shall die if I should lose Monica.
(Oh Monica my love.)
People can try,
People can try, but they can't buy Monica, my love.

You take the sunshine,
I'll take the nightly shadows.
'Cause everyone knows that Monica glows at night.
She'll do something wrong and prove to you she is right.

I, I shall die,
I, I shall die if I should lose Monica.
(Oh Monica my love.)
People may try,
People may try, but they can't buy Monica, my love.

Morning to moonshine,
Monica knows every line.
Don't ever propose 'cause Monica knows, you know.
She'll turn up her nose and say what a fool you are.
Monica.


People take pictures of the Summer,
Just in case someone thought they had missed it,
And to proved that it really existed.
Fathers take pictures of the mothers,
And the sisters take pictures of brothers,
Just to show that they love one another.

You can't picture love that you took from me,
When we were young and the world was free.
Pictures of things as they used to be,
Don't show me no more, please.

People take pictures of each other,
Just to prove that they really existed,
Just to prove that they really existed.
People take pictures of each other,
And the moment to last them for ever,
Of the time when they mattered to someone.

People take pictures of the Summer,
Just in case someone thought they had missed it,
Just to proved that it really existed.
People take pictures of each other,
And the moment to last them for ever,
Of the time when they mattered to someone.
Picture of me when I was just three,
Sucking my thumb by the old oak tree.
Oh how I love things as they used to be,
Don't show me no more, please.


Thank you for the days,
Those endless days, those sacred days you gave me.
I'm thinking of the days,
I won't forget a single day, believe me.

I bless the light,
I bless the light that lights on you believe me.
And though you're gone,
You're with me every single day, believe me.

Days I'll remember all my life,
Days when you can't see wrong from right.
You took my life,
But then I knew that very soon you'd leave me,
But it's all right,
Now I'm not frightened of this world, believe me.

I wish today could be tomorrow,
The night is dark,
It just brings sorrow anyway.

Long ago life was clean
Sex was bad and obscene
And the rich were so mean
Stately homes for the Lords
Croquet lawns, village greens
Victoria was my queen
Victoria, Victoria, Victoria, 'toria

I was born, lucky me
In a land that I love
Though I am poor, I am free
When I grow I shall fight
For this land I shall die
Let her sun never set
Victoria, Victoria, Victoria, 'toria
Victoria, Victoria, Victoria, toria

Land of hope and gloria
Land of my Victoria
Land of hope and gloria
Land of my Victoria
Victoria, 'toria
Victoria, Victoria, Victoria, 'toria

Canada to India
Australia to Cornwall
Singapore to Hong Kong
From the West to the East
From the rich to the poor
Victoria loved them all
Victoria, Victoria, Victoria, 'toria
Victoria, Victoria, Victoria


Yes Sir, no Sir
Where do I go Sir
What do I do Sir
What do I say

Yes Sir, no Sir
Where do I go Sir
What do I do Sir
How do I behave

Yes Sir, no Sir
Permission to speak Sir
Permission to breathe Sir
What do I say, how do I behave, what do I say

So you think that you've got ambition
Stop your dreaming and your idle wishing
You're outside and there ain't no admission
To our play
Pack up your ambition in your old kit bag
Soon you'll be happy with a packet of fags
Chest out stomach in
Do what I say, do what I say
Yes right away

Yes Sir, no Sir
Where do I go Sir
What do I do Sir
What do I say

Yes Sir, no Sir
Permission to speak Sir
Permission to breathe Sir
What do I say, how do I behave, what do I say

Doesn't matter who you are
You're there and there you are
Everything Is in its place
Authority must be maintained
And then we know exactly where we are
Let them feel that they're important to the cause
But let them know that they are fighting for their homes
Just be sure that they're contributing their all
Give the scum a gun and make the bugger fight
And be sure to have deserters shot on sight
If he dies we'll send a medal to his wife

Yes Sir, no Sir
Please let me die Sir
I think this life is affecting my brain
Yes Sir, no Sir
Three bags full Sir
What do I do Sir, what do I say
What do I say, how do I behave, what do I say


Some mother's son lies in a field
Someone has killed some mother's son today
Head blown up by some soldier's gun
While all the mothers stand and wait
Some mother's son ain't coming home today
Some mothers son ain't got no grave

Two soldiers fighting in a trench
One soldier glances up to see the sun
And dreams of games he played when he was young
And then his friend calls out his name
It stops his dream and as he turns his head
A second later he is dead

Some mother's son lies in a field
Back home they put his picture in a frame
But all dead soldiers look the same
While all the parents stand and wait
To meet their children coming home from school
Some mother's son is lying dead

Somewhere someone is crying
Someone is trying to be so brave
But still the world keeps turning
Though all the children have gone away

Some mother's son lies in a field
But in his mother's eyes he looks the same
As on the day he went away

They put his picture on the wall
They put flowers in the picture frame
Some mothers memory remains


It seems like all the world is fighting
They're even talking of a war
Let all the Russians and the Chinese
And the Spanish do their fighting
The sun is shining
We're going drivin', drivin'

Drop all your work
Leave it behind
Forget all your problems
And get in my car
And take a drive with me

The sandwiches are packed
The tea is in the flask
We've plenty of beer
And gooseberry tarts
So take a drive with me

We'll take your mother if you want to
We'll have a picnic on the grass
Forget your nephews
And your cousins and your brothers and your sisters
They'll never miss us
'Cos we'll be drivin', drivin'. drivin'. drivin'

Thousands of trees
Hundreds of fields
Millions of birds
So why don't you come
And take a drive with me

We'll talk to the cows
And laugh at the sheep
We'll lie in a field
And we'll have a sleep
So take a drive with me

And all the troubled world around us
Seems an eternity away
And all the debt collectors
Rent collectors
All will be behind us
But they'll never find us
'Cos we'll be drivin', drivin', drivin', drivin'

Passed Barnet Church
Up to Potters Bar
We won't be home late
It's not very far
So take a drive with me, take a drive with me
Drivin', drivin', drivin', drivin'


You look like a real human being
But you don't have a mind of your own
Yeah, you can talk, you can breathe
You can work, you can stitch, you can sew
But you're brainwashed
Yes you are, yes you are
Get down on your knees
You've got a job and a house
And a wife, and your kids and a car
Yeah, you're conditioned to be
What they want you to be
And be happy to be where you are
Yes you are
Get down on your knees
Get down on your knees

The aristocrats and bureaucrats
Are dirty rats
For making you what you are
They're up there and you re down here
You're on the ground and they're up with the stars
All your life they've kicked you around and pushed you around
Till you can't take any more
To them you're just a speck of dirt
But you don't want to get up off the floor
Mister you're just brainwashed
They give you social security
Tax saving benefits that grow at maturity
Yeah, you're conditioned to be
What they want you to be
And to do what they want you to
Yes you are, yes you are
Get down on your knees

Now that you've found your paradise
This is your Kingdom to command
You can go outside and polish your car
Or sit by the fire in your Shangri-la
Here is your reward for working so hard
Gone are the lavatories in the back yard
Gone are the days when you dreamed of that car
You just want to sit in your Shangri-la

Put on your slippers and sit by the fire
You've reached your top and you just can't get any higher
You're in your place and you know where you are
In your Shangri-la
Sit back in your old rocking chair
You need not worry, you need not care
You can't go anywhere
Shangri-la, Shangri-la, Shangri-la

The little man who gets the train
Got a mortgage hanging over his head
But he's too scared to complain
'Cos he's conditioned that way
Time goes by and he pays off his debts
Got a TV set and a radio
For seven shillings a week
Shangri-la, Shangri-la, Shangri-la, Shangri-la, Shangri-la, Shangri-la

And all the houses in the street have got a name
'Cos all the houses in the street they look the same
Same chimney pots, same little cars, same window panes
The neighbors call to tell you things that you should know
They say their lines, they drink their tea, and then they go
They tell your business in another Shangri-la
The gas bills and the water rates, and payments on the car
Too scared to think about how insecure you are
Life ain't so happy in your little Shangri-la
Shangri-la, Shangri-la la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Put on your slippers and sit by the fire
You've reached your top and you just can't get any higher
You're in your place and you know where you are
In your Shangri-la
Sit back in your old rocking chair
You need not worry, you need not care
You can't go anywhere
Shangri-la, Shangri-la, Shangri-la, Shangri-la, Shangri-la, Shangri-la


Well Mr. Churchill says, Mr. Churchill says
We gotta fight the bloody battle to the very end
Mr. Beaverbrook says we gotta save our tin
And all the garden gates
And empty cans are gonna make us win

We shall defend our island
On the land and on the sea
We shall fight them on the beaches
On the hills and in the fields
We shall fight them in the streets
Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed to so few
'Cos they have made our British Empire
A better place for me and you
And this was their finest hour
Well Mr. Montgomery says
And Mr. Mountbatten says
We gotta fight the bloody battle to the very end
As Vera Lynn would say
We'll meet again someday
But all the sacrifices we must make before the end

Did you hear that plane flying overhead
There's a house an fire and there's someone lying dead
We gotta clean up the streets
And get me back on my feet
Because we wanna be free
Do your worst and we'll do our best
We're gonna win the way that Mr. Churchill says
Oh! oh! oh! oh! oh! oh! Well Mr. Churchill says
We gotta hold up our chins
We gotta show some courage and some discipline
We gotta black up the windows and nail up the doors
And keep right on till the end of the war


She's bought a hat like Princess Marina's
To wear at all her social affairs
She wears it when she's cleaning the windows
She wears it when she's scrubbing the stairs
But you will never see her at Ascot
She can't afford the time or the fare
But she's bought a hat like Princess Marina's
So she don't care

He's bought a hat like Anthony Eden's
Because it makes him feel like a Lord
But he can't afford a Rolls or a Bentley
He has to buy a secondhand Ford
He tries to feed his wife and his family
And buy them clothes and shoes they can wear
But he's bought a hat like Anthony Eden's
So he don t care

Buddy can you spare me a dime
My wife is getting hungry
And the kids are crying
This poverty is hurting my pride
Buddy can you spare me, buddy can you spare me a dime

She's bought a hat like Princess Marina's
And her neighbors think it suits her a treat
But she hasn't any food in the larder
Nor has anybody else in the street
But to look at her you'd think she was wealthy
'Cos she smiles just like a real millionaire
'Cos she's bought a hat like Princess Marina's
So she don't care, she don't care, she don't care, she don't care


I look back at the way I used to look at life
Soft, white dreams with sugar coated outside
It was great, so great
Young and innocent days

I wish my eyes could only see
Everything, exactly as it used to be
It's too late, so late
Young and innocent days

I see the lines across your face
Time has gone and nothing ever can replace
Those great, so great
Young and innocent days


Remember walking with you by my side
You were my Papa and I was your pride
Now I've got children and I'm going grey
No time for talking I got nothin' to say

Those Sunday dinners that we had at home
Now I've got a house and I've got friends of my own
We can't do tomorrow what we did yesterday
It's best that we're going our separate ways, OK

How is your rheumatism (nothing to say)
How are your chillblains (nothing to say)
How's Aunty Mabel (nothing to say)
So far Papa, I got nothin' to say, OK

Those happy days we spent together
We thought our world would never change
How the days go by
And things will never be the same

You keep pretending that everything's fine
So you make small talk to help pass the time
But all the words that you spit from your face
Add up to nothin' you got nothin' to say

How are those noisy neighbors next door
I'll have to go soon 'cos I'm getting bored
I gotta be home early to see a good play
So far Papa, I got nothin' to say

How is your life insurance (nothing to say)
How is your trade union (nothing to say)
How is your Independence (nothing to say)
So for Papa, I got nothin' to say


Arthur was born just a plain simple man
In a plain simple working class position
Though the world was hard and its ways were set
He was young and he had so much ambition
All the way he was overtaken
By the people who make the big decisions

And a way to improve his own condition

Things would be more equal and be plenty for everyone

I've been traveling a long time,
To be just where you are.
In dreams I have seen you,
But you are so very far.

How long must I travel on,
To be just where you are?
How long must I travel on,
To be just where you are?

I was your friend,
I was a fool,
I feel for you, though we're far apart.
I see your face,
Lost without trace,
I see your mind, just an empty space.

Mindless child of motherhood,
You have lost the thing that's good.
Mindless child of motherhood,
You have lost the thing that's good.

I know that it's not fair,
To bare a bastard son,
But why do you hide there,
When we could have shared a love?

How long must I travel on,
To be just where you are?
How long must I travel on,

I wish that you could see
All the things that I have seen.
This mind of mine is making life worthwhile.
I wish that you'd have know
Of all the plans I had in store for us,
Laughing, dancing, traveling the world on our own.

And this man, he weeps tonight,
And his head is bowed with sorrow,
But what can you do, sitting there,
And you let him cry tomorrow,
Yes, you'll let him cry tomorrow.
Yes, you'll let him cry tomorrow.

I thought our thing would last,
'Cause it said so in my horoscope,
The days have gone and past while dreaming away.
The lighting here is dim,
And the room closes in around me.
Your picture's hanging loose on a rusting nail.

And this man, he weeps tonight,
And his head is bowed with sorrow,
But what can you do, sitting there,
And you let him cry tomorrow,

Hush little mammy don't you cry
I've got to see what it's like on the world outside
Got to get out of this life somehow
Got to be free, got to be free now

I don't want to be a constructor of highways
A sweeper of sidewalks, I've got to do it my way
I'm too ill-equipped for a mathematician
A shrewd politician, a maker of decisions

We're not the greatest when when we're separated
But when we're together I think we're going to make it
I don't want to be like a fascist dictator
A saint or a sinner, I want to be a winner


Where are you going I don't mind
I've killed my world and I've killed my time
So where do I go what do I see
I see many people coming after me
So where are you going to I don't mind
If I live too long I'm afraid I'll die
So I will follow you wherever you go
If your offered hand is still open to me
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one
So you've been where I've just come
From the land that brings losers on
So we will share this road we walk
And mind our mouths and beware our talk
'Till peace we find tell you what I'll do
All the things I own I will share with you
If I feel tomorrow like I feel today
We'll take what we want and give the rest away
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one
Holy man and holy priest
This love of life makes me weak at my knees
And when we get there make your play
'Cos soon I feel you're gonna carry us away
In a promised lie you made us believe
For many men there is so much grief
And my mind is proud but it aches with rage
And if I live too long I'm afraid I'll die
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one


Down the way from the Tottenham Court Road
Just round the corner from old Soho
There's a place where the publishers go
If you don't know which way to go
Just open your ears and follow your nose
'Cos the street is shakin' from the tapping of toes
You can hear that music play anytime on any day
Every rhythm, every way
You got to a publisher and play him your song
He says 'I hate your music and you hair is too long
But I'll sign you up because I'd hate to be wrong'
You've got a tune it's in your head you want to get it placed
So you take it up to a music man just to see what he will say
He says 'I hate the tune, I hate the words but I'll tell you what I'll do
I'll sign you up and take it round the street and see if it makes the grade'
And you might even hear it played on the rock 'n' roll hit parade
Daytime, night time, every week you can hear that heavy beat
Now the walls are shaking from the tapping of feet
Daytime, night time, every day you can hear that music play
Every rhythm, every way


Facing the world ain't easy when there isn't anything going
Standing at the corner waiting watching time go by
Will I go to work today or shall I bide my time
'Cos when I see that union man walking down the street
He's the man who decides if I live or I die, if I starve, or I eat
Then he walks up to me and the sun begins to shine
Then he walks right past and I know that I've got to get back in the line
Now I think of what my mamma told me
She always said that it would never ever work out
But all I want to do is make some money
And bring you home some wine
For I don't ever want you to see me
Standing in that line
'Cause that union man's got such a hold over me
He's the man who decides if I live or I die, if I starve, or I eat
Then he walks up to me and the sun begins to shine
Then he walks right past and I know that I've got to get back in the line


I met her in a club down in old Soho
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like cherry-cola [LP version - Coca-Cola:]
C O L A cola
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said Lola
L O L A Lola la-la-la-la Lola

Well I'm not the world's most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine
Oh my Lola la-la-la-la Lola
Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand
Why she walked like a woman and talked like a man
Oh my Lola la-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola

Well we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candlelight
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
And said little boy won't you come home with me
Well I'm not the world's most passionate guy
But when I looked in her eyes well I almost fell for my Lola
La-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola
Lola la-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola
I pushed her away
I walked to the door
I fell to the floor
I got down on my knees
Then I looked at her and she at me

Well that's the way that I want it to stay
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
It's a mixed up muddled up shook up world except for Lola
La-la-la-la Lola

Well I left home just a week before
And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
But Lola smiled and took me by the hand
And said dear boy I'm gonna make you a man

Well I'm not the world's most masculine man
But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man
And so is Lola
La-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola
Lola la-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola


I've just come in at Number 25
I'm oh so happy, so glad to be alive
And everybody says it's going to get to the top
Life is so easy when your record's hot.
Go tell my mamma and my sister too
To press my trousers and polish my shoes
I might even end up a rock-and-roll god
It might turn into a steady job.
And my agent said to me: "Son, I always told you so."
Now my record's number 11 on the BBC
But number seven on the N.M.E.
Not the Melody Maker want to interview me
And ask my view on politics and theories on religion.
Now my record's up to number 3
And a woman recognized me and started to scream
This all seems like a crazy dream
I've been invited to a dinner with a prominent queen
And now I've got friends that I never knew I had before.
It's strange how people want you when you record's high
'Cos when it drops down they just pass you by
Now my agent just called me and said it me:
"Son your record's just got to Number One."


Robert owes half to Grenville
Who in turn gave half to Larry
Who adored my instrumentals
And so he gave half to a foreign publisher
She took half the money that was earned in some far distant land
Gave back half to Larry and I end up with half of goodness knows what
Oh can somebody explain why things go on this way
I thought they were my friends I can't believe it's me, I can't believe that I'm so green
Eyes down round and round let's all sit and watch the moneygoround
Everyone take a little bit here and a little bit there
Do they all deserve money from a song that they've never heard
They don't know the tune and they don't know the words
But they don't give a damn
There's no end to it I'm in a pit and I'm stuck in it
The money goes round and around and around
And it comes out here when they've all taken their share
I went to see a solicitor and my story was heard and the writs were served
On the verge of a nervous breakdown I decided to fight right to the end
But if I ever get my money I'll be too old and grey to spend it
Oh, but life goes on and on and no one ever wins
And time goes quickly by just like the moneygoround
I only hope that I'll survive


This time tomorrow where will we be
On a spaceship somewhere, sailing across an empty sea
This time tomorrow what will we know
Will we still be here, watching an in-flight movie show
I'll leave the sun behind me and I'll watch the clouds as they sadly pass me by
Seven miles below me I can see the world and it ain't so big at all
Well, this time tomorrow what will we see
Fields full of houses, endless rows of crowded streets
I don't know where I'm going, I don't want to see
I feel the world below me looking up at me

Leave the sun behind me, and watch the clouds as they sadly pass me by
And I'm in perpetual motion and the world below doesn't matter much to me
Well, this time tomorrow where will we be
On a spaceship somewhere, sailing across any empty sea
Well, this time tomorrow where will we be
This time tomorrow what will we see
This time tomorrow


You've come a long way from the runny-nosed and scruffy kid I knew
You had such good ways
I can remember the little things that always made you smile
They made you happy
Now you think you're wiser because you're older and you think
That money buys everything
And you think you need no one to guide you
But you're still a long way from home.
You've come a long way, you're self-assured and dressed in
Funny clothes, but you don't know me.
I hope you find what you are looking for with your car and handmade overcoats
But your wealth will never make you stronger 'cos you're still a
Long way from home
Yes, you're still a long way from home


I was lost just wandering round downtown
Many people pushing me around
Hate spreads just like infection
Those rats jumping on and off my back
Fat black rats holding me down
I see rats in every direction
No time to catch your breath
Crazy people lost their heads
Masses trampling on my feet, inconsiderate in their heat
Those rats breeding angriness and spite
Never have done anything right for people like you and me
Walk over all the people you can't see
If they die there's more bread for me
Like snakes crawling through the grass
No time to catch your breath
Crazy people lost their heads
Masses trampling on my feet, inconsiderate in their heat
Those rats breeding angriness and spite
Never have done anything right for people like you and me
See that face man look at me, he's much too selfish to see
Once he was warm and was kind
Now all he has got is a pinstripe mind
See that face man look at me, he's much too selfish to see
Once he was warm and was kind
Now all he has got is a pinstripe mind


I think I'm sophisticated
'Cos I'm living my life like a good homosapien
But all around me everybody's multiplying
Till they're walking round like flies man
So I'm no better than the animals sitting in their cages
In the zoo man
'Cos compared to the flowers and the birds and the trees
I am an ape man
I think I'm so educated and I'm so civilized
'Cos I'm a strict vegetarian
But with the over-population and inflation and starvation
And the crazy politicians
I don't feel safe in this world no more
I don't want to die in a nuclear war
I want to sail away to a distant shore and make like an ape man
I'm an ape man, I'm an ape ape man
I'm an ape man I'm a King Kong man I'm ape ape man
I'm an ape man
'Cos compared to the sun that sits in the sky
Compared to the clouds as they roll by
Compared to the bugs and the spiders and flies
I am an ape man
In man's evolution he has created the cities and
The motor traffic rumble, but give me half a chance
And I'd be taking off my clothes and living in the jungle
'Cos the only time that I feel at ease
Is swinging up and down in a coconut tree
Oh what a life of luxury to be like an ape man
I'm an ape, I'm an ape ape man, I'm an ape man
I'm a King Kong man, I'm a voo-doo man
I'm an ape man
I look out my window, but I can't see the sky
'Cos the air pollution is fogging up my eyes
I want to get out of this city alive
And make like an ape man
Come and love me, be my ape man girl
And we will be so happy in my ape man world
I'm an ape man, I'm an ape ape man, I'm an ape man
I'm a King Kong man, I'm a voo-doo man
I'm an ape man
I'll be your Tarzan, you'll be my Jane
I'll keep you warm and you'll keep me sane
And we'll sit in the trees and eat bananas all day
Just like an ape man
I'm an ape man, I'm an ape ape man, I'm an ape man
I'm a King Kong man, I'm a voo-doo man
I'm an ape man.
I don't feel safe in this world no more
I don't want to die in a nuclear war
I want to sail away to a distant shore
And make like an ape man.


I know a man, he's a powerful man
He's got the people in his power
In the palm of his hand.
He started at the bottom and he worked his way up
Now he's never going to stop
Until he reaches the top.
It's the same old story, it's the same old dream,
It's power man, power man, and all that it can bring.
If you want your money, you better stand in the line
'Cos you'll only end up picking up nickels and dimes.
You call him names and he sits and grins
'Cos everybody else is just a sucker to him.
And he's got my money, but I've got my faith
And powerman, powerman, I'll never be your slave.
It's the same old story, it's the same old game
It's power man, power man, driving me insane
People tried to conquer the world Napoleon and Genghis Khan
Hitler tried and Mussolini too
Powerman don't need to fight, powerman don't need no guns
Powerman got money on his side
Well I'm not rich and I'm not free
But I've got my girl and she got me
He's got my money and my publishing rights
But I've got my girl and I'm alright
And she got me going, and she keeps me sane
But powerman, powerman, got money on the brain
It's the same old story it's the same old game
Powerman, powerman driving me insane


Hush little baby don't you cry
Soon the sun is going to shine
We're going to be free like the birds and the bees
Running wild in the big country
Got to be free to do what I want
Walk if I want, talk if I want
Got to be free to say what I want
Make what I want and play what I want
As free as the birds up in the sky
As free as the bugs and the spiders and flies
I don't know how but I'm gonna try
I've just got to be free
And it won't be long 'cos we're right
And they are wrong
We've got to get out of this world somehow
We've got to be free, we've got to be free now
Got to be free to laugh when I want
Think what I want and cry if I like
Got to be free to do what I want
Say what I want and swear if I like
As free as the sun and the moon in the sky
As free as a flea or a proud butterfly
I don't know how but I'm gonna try
I've just got to be free
Yeah, we've got to get out of this world somehow
We've got to be free, we've got to be free now
Got to be free to do what I want
Walk if I want and talk if I want
Got to be free to say what I want
Make what I want and play what I want
I've got to be proud and stand up straight
And let people see I ain't nobody's slave
I've got to be free before it's too late
I've just got to be free
Got to be free to do what I want
Walk if I want, talk if I want


This is the age of machinery,
A mechanical nightmare,
The wonderful world of technology,
Napalm, hydrogen bombs, biological warfare,

This is the twentieth century,
But too much aggravation
It's the age of insanity,
What has become of the green pleasant fields of Jerusalem.

Ain't got no ambition, I'm just disillusioned
I'm a twentieth century man but I don't wanna be here.
My mama said she can't understand me
She can't see my motivation
Just give me some security,
I'm a paranoid schizoid product of the twentieth century.

You keep all your smart modern writers
Give me William Shakespeare
You keep all your smart modern painters
I'll take Rembrandt, Titian, Da Vinci and Gainsborough,

Girl we gotta get out of here
We gotta find a solution
I'm a twentieth century man but I don't want to die here.

I was born in a welfare state
Ruled by bureaucracy
Controlled by civil servants
And people dressed in grey
Got no privacy, got no liberty
Cos the twentieth century people
Took it all away from me.

Don't wanna get myself shot down
By some trigger happy policeman,
Gotta keep a hold on my sanity
I'm a twentieth century man but I don't wanna die here.

My mama says she can't understand me
She can't see my motivation
Ain't got no security,
I'm a twentieth century man but I don't wanna be here.

This is the twentieth century
But too much aggravation
This is the edge of insanity
I'm a twentieth century man but I don't wanna be here.


I'm too terrified to walk out of my own front door,
They're demonstrating outside I think they're gonna start the third world war,
I've been to my local head shrinker,
To help classify my disease,
He said it's one of the cases of acute schizophrenia he sees.

Well the milkman's a spy, and the grocer keeps on following me,
And the woman next door's an undercover for the K.G.B.,
And the man from the Social Security
Keeps on invading my privacy,
Oh there ain't no cure for acute schizophrenia disease.

I've got acute schizophrenia, paranoia too,
Schizophrenia, schizophrenia,
I've got it, you've got it, we can't lose,
Acute schizophrenia blues.

I'm lost on the river, the river of no return,
I can't make decisions, I don't know which way I'm gonna turn,
Even my old dad, lost some of the best friends he ever had,
Apparently, his was a case of acute schizophrenia too.

I got acute schizophrenia, paranoia too,
Schizophrenia, schizophrenia,
I've got it, you've got it, we can't lose,

They're watching my house and they're tapping my telephone,
I don't trust nobody, but I'm much too scared to be on my own
And the income tax collector's got his beady eye on me,
No there ain't no cure for acute schizophrenia disease.

No there ain't no cure for
Schizophrenia disease.


Holiday,
Oh what a lovely day today,
I'm oh so glad they sent me away,
To have a little holiday today, holiday.
Holiday,
And I'm just standing on the end of a pier,
Hoping and dreaming you were here,
To share my little holiday.

Lookin' in the sky for a gap in the clouds,
Sometimes I think that sun ain't never coming out,
But I'd rather be here than in that dirty old town,
I had to leave the city cos it really brought me down.

Oh holiday, oh what a lovely day today,
I think I'll get down on my little ol' knees and pray, thank you Lord,
Thank heaven for this holiday today, holiday.
I'm leaving insecurity behind me,
The environmental pressures got me down,
I don't need no sedatives to pull me round,
I don't need no sleeping pills to help me sleep sound.

Oh holiday,
Oh what a lovely day today,
I think I'll get down on my little ol' knees and pray,
That's what I'll do,
Thank heaven for this holiday.

Lying on the beach with my back burned rare,
The salt gets in my blisters and the sand gets in my hair,
And the sea's an open sewer,
But I really couldn't care,
I'm breathing through my mouth so I don't have to sniff the air.

Oh holiday,
Oh what a lovely day today,
I'm so glad they sent me away,
To have a little holiday.


Fat Flabby Annie was incredibly big
She weighed just about sixteen stone
And then a fake dietician went and put her on a diet
Now she looks like skin and bone
She looks like skin and bone

Do the meditation and yoga
And she's thrown away the good food guide
And she's given up the alcohol and pizzas
And the pies and now she looks as if she's ready to die,
You can't see her walk by

Don't eat no mashed potatoes,
Don't eat no buttered scones
Stay away from carbohydrates
You're gonna look like skin and bone.

Living on the edge of starvation
And she says she's got no appetite
And her father and her mother
And her sisters and her brothers
Couldn't see her when she walked by
You can't see her walk by.

She don't eat no mashed potatoes,
She don't eat no buttered scones
Stay away from carbohydrates
You're gonna look like skin and bone.

She used to be so cuddly,
She used to be so fat,
But oh what a sin cos she's oh so thin
That she lost all the friends that she had,
She looks like skin and bone

If you look flabby
And you feel overweight,
And you wanna lose a couple of stone,
Take a crash course diet do your daily exercises
And you'll look like skin and bone.

Come on rattle them bones,
Put your hands up to the ceiling,
Bend your hips and touch your toes,
Do your daily exercises,
You're gonna look like skin and bone,

Don't eat no mashed potatoes,
Don't eat no buttered scones
Don't eat no carbohydrates
You're gonna look like skin and bone.


Here's a story about a sinner,
He used to be a winner who enjoyed a life of prominence and position,
But the pressures at the office and his socialite engagements,
And his selfish wife's fanatical ambition,
It turned him to the booze,
And he got mixed up with a floosie
And she led him to a life of indecision.
The floosie made him spend his dole
She left him lying on Skid Row
A drunken lag in some Salvation Army Mission.
It's such a shame.

Oh demon alcohol,
Sad memories I cannot recall,
Who thought I would say,
Damn it all and blow it all,
Oh demon alcohol,
Memories I cannot recall,
Who thought I would fall a slave to demon alcohol.
Sad memories I cannot recall,
Who thought I would fall a slave to demon alcohol.

Barley wine, pink gin,
He'll drink anything,
Port, pernod or tequila,
Rum, scotch, vodka on the rocks,
As long as all his troubles disappeared.
But he messed up his life, went and beat up his wife,
And the floosie's gone and found another sucker
She's gonna turn him on to drink
She's gonna lead him to the brink
And when his money's gone,
She'll leave him in the gutter,
It's such a shame.

Oh demon alcohol,
Sad memories I cannot recall,
Who thought I would say,
Damn it all and blow it all,

Sad memories I cannot recall,
Who thought I would fall,
A slave to demon alcohol.


Well I woke this morning with a pain in my neck,
A pain in my heart and a pain in my chest,
I went to the doctor and the good doctor said,
You gotta slow down your life or you're gonna be dead,
Cut out the struggle and strife,
It only complicates your life.

Well I cut down women, I cut out booze,
I stopped ironing my shirts, cleaning my shoes,
I stopped going to work, stopped reading the news,
I sit and twiddle my thumbs cos I got nothing to do,
Minimal exercise,
To help uncomplicate my life,
Gotta stand and face it life is so complicated,
Ladi dah di dahdah, ladi dah di dah dah,
You gotta get away from the complicated life, son,
Life is overrated, life is complicated,
Must alleviate this complicated life.

Cut out the struggle and strife,
It's such a complicated life.

Like old Mother Hubbard
I got nothin' in the cupboard,
Got no dinner and I got no supper,
Holes in my shoes, I got holes in my socks,
I can't go to work cos I can't get a job,
The bills are rising sky high,
It's such a complicated life,
Gotta stand and face it,
Life is so complicated.
Ladi dah di dahdah, ladi dah di dah dah
Gotta get away from the complicated life, son,
Life is overrated, life is complicated,
Must alleviate this complicated life.

Gotta get away from the complicated life, son,
Gotta get away from the complicated life.


I got a letter this morning with some serious news that's gone and ruined my day,
The borough surveyor's used compulsory purchase to acquire my domain,
They're gonna pull up the floors, they're gonna knock down the walls,
They're gonna dig up the drains.

Here come the people in grey, they're gonna take me away to Lord knows only where,
But I'm so unprepared, I got no time to pack and I got nothing to wear,
Here come the people in grey,
To take me away.

Me and my baby gonna get on a train that's gonna take us away,
We're gonna live in a tent, we're gonna pay no more rent, we're gonna pay no more rates,
We're gonna live in a field, we're gonna buy me gun to keep the policemen away.

I'm gonna pass me a brand new resolution,
I'm gonna fight me a one man revolution, someway,
Gonna beat those people in grey,
But here come the people in grey,
To take me away.

Here come the people in grey,
To take me away.

People in grey have gone and taken away my right to voice my complaint,
Her Majesty's Government have sent me a form, I must complete it today.
But it's making me blue, don't wanna tell all my secrets to
The people in grey.

Gonna pass me a brand new resolution,
Gonna fight me a one man revolution, someway,
Gonna start my rebellion today.
But here come the people in grey,
To take me away.

Oh, Lord, those people in grey,
I gotta get back at those people in grey,
Here come the people in grey,
To take me away.


Granny's always ravin' and rantin',
And she's always puffin' and pantin',
And she's always screaming and shouting,
And she's always brewing up tea.

Grandpappy's never late for his dinner,
Cos he loves his leg of beef
And he washes it down with a brandy,
And a fresh made pot of tea.

[Chorus:]
Have a cuppa tea, have a cuppa tea,
Have a cuppa tea, have a cuppa tea,
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, Rosie Lea
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, Rosie Lea.

If you feel a bit under the weather,
If you feel a little bit peeved,
Take granny's stand-by potion
For any old cough or wheeze.
It's a cure for hepatitis, it's a cure for chronic insomnia,
It's a cure for tonsillitis and for water on the knee.

[Chorus]

Tea in the morning, tea in the evening, tea at supper time,
You get tea when it's raining, tea when it's snowing,
Tea when the weather's fine.
You get tea as a mid-day stimulant
You get tea with your afternoon tea
For any old ailment or disease
For Christ sake have a cuppa tea.

[Chorus]

Whatever the situation, whatever the race or creed,
Tea knows no segregation, no class nor pedigree
It knows no motivations, no sect or organisation,
It knows no one religion,
Nor political belief.

[Chorus]


They took my baby to Holloway jail,
They took my baby, down Holloway jail,
She was a lady when she went in,
Now she's in jail, and it's giving me hell.

She was just succeeding in the city,
She was just beginning to excel,
And then a spiv named Frankie Simes
Led her to a life of crime,
And led her on the downward trail.

Frankie came home late from work one evening,
The C.I.D. were hot on his trail,
Frankie promised everything,
And then he went and turned her in,
She went and took the rap for him,
Now she's impaled in Holloway jail.

They took my baby, down Holloway jail,
They took my baby to Holloway jail,
There ain't no pity, there ain't no bail,
And she assures me that it's living hell.

She was young and ever so pretty,
Now she looks so old and pale,
She never sees the day,
She wastes her life away,
Sitting in that prison cell.

They took my baby to Holloway jail,
They locked my baby in Holloway jail,
She was a lady when she went in,
Now she's in jail, and it's giving me hell.

She's impaled, in Holloway jail.


All life we work but work is bore,
If life's for livin' what's livin' for,
She lives in a house that's near decay,
Built for the industrial revolution,
But in her dreams she is far away,
In Oklahoma U.S.A.
With Shirley Jones and Gordon McRea,
As she buys her paper at the corner shop,
She's walkin' on the surrey with the fringe on top,
Cos in her dreams she is far away,
In Oklahoma U.S.A.,
She walks to work but she's still in a daze,
She's Rita Hayworth or Doris Day,
And Errol Flynn's gonna take her away,
To Oklahoma U.S.A.,
All life we work but work is a bore,
If life's for livin' then what's livin' for.


He was just a workin' man,
Simple rules and simple plans,
Fancy words he didn't understand,
He loved with his heart,
He worked with his hands.

Liberals dream of equal rights,
Conservatives live in a world gone by,
Socialists preach of a promised land,
But old Uncle Son was an ordinary man.

Bless you Uncle Son,
They won't forget you when the revolution comes.

Unionists tell you when to strike,
Generals tell you when to fight,
Preachers teach you wrong from right,
They'll feed you when you're born,
And use you all your life.

Bless you Uncle Son,
They won't forget you when the revolution comes.


Well I said goodbye to Rosie Rooke this morning
I'm gonna miss her bloodshot alcoholic eyes
She wore her Sunday hat so she'd impress me
I'm gonna carry her memory 'til the day I die

They'll move me up to Muswell Hill tomorrow
Photographs and souvenirs are all I've got
They're gonna try and make me change my way of living
But they'll never make me something that I'm not

Cos I'm a Muswell Hillbilly boy
But my heart lies in old West Virginia
Never seen New Orleans, Oklahoma, Tennessee
Still I dream of the Black Hills that I ain't never seen

They're putting us identical little boxes
No character just uniformity
They're trying to build a computerised community
But they'll never make a zombie out of me

They'll try and make me study elocution
Because they say my accent isn't right
They can clear the slums as part of their solution
But they're never gonna kill my cockney pride

Cos I'm a Muswell Hillbilly boy
But my heart lies in Old West Virginia
Though my hills, they're not green
I've seen them in my dreams
Take me back to those Black Hills
That I ain't never seen

Well I'm a Muswell Hillbilly boy
But my heart lies in Old West Virginia
Though my hills, they're not green
I've seen them in my dreams
Take me back to those Black Hills
That I ain't never seen


They lived together in a dirty old shack
At the edge of the black rocky mountain
And they drank mountain dew and they lived on the food
That they grew at the side of the mountain

She's a mountain woman, he's her mountain man
They lived all their lives by the valley
She's a mountain woman, he's her mountain man
Uneducated but they're happy

Mountain woman couldn't read nor write
But she knew good from evil, she knew wrong from right
When the government tried to buy her water rights
Her intuition was her only guide

She's a mountain woman, he's her mountain man
Lived all their lives by the valley
She's a mountain woman, he's her mountain man
Uneducated but they're happy
Spend my life with my mountain woman
We're uneducated by we're happy

The civil servant used compulsory purchase
To acquire the valley for the nation
They'll dig up the land, they're gonna make a dam
And build a hydroelectric power station

And now she lives on the 33rd floor
Of a man-made concrete mountain
She got an elevator and refrigerator
And an automobile to run around in

Fast talkin' lawyers from the government
Went and beat proud mountain woman down
Hey mountain woman, take your mountain man
They took your land and flood your valley

Spend my life with my mountain woman
They're uneducated by they're happy


Never been anywhere south of the Delaware
Never been through Kalamazoo
Never been to Timbuktu

Living is fantasy, traveling mentally
Making up tunes in hotel rooms
'Bout places I've never been to

Though I've never crooned under a Kentucky moon

I had my dream, Kentucky moon
But it's only moon dreams
From songs, films and TV
But I can visualize what I've never seen
But I had my dream, Kentucky moon

Route 66 to me is still a mystery
And Ohio, too
Went Chicago blue down to St. Louie blues

Never been anywhere south of the Delaware
Never been through Kalamazoo
Never been to Timbuktu

But I can visualize what I've never seen
So I sit and dream, Kentucky moon

As I sit by a stream in the moon
But it's just imagery
From songs, films and TV
But I can visualize what I've never seen
So I sit and dream, Kentucky moon
