Sometimes I'm looking somewhere
And I don't like what I see
Seems like my soul is made of paper
So I took a look outside myself
Trying to get myself together
Things have changed, now I find
I've just been messing, messing up my mind

So now my troubles are all over

As I walk along I wonder a-what went wrong
With our love, a love that was so strong
And as I still walk on, I think of the things we’ve done
Together, a-while our hearts were young

I'm a-walkin' in the rain
Tears are fallin' and I feel the pain
Wishin' you were here by me
To end this misery
And I wonder
I wa-wa-wa-wa-wonder
Why
Ah-why-why-why-why-why she ran away
And I wonder where she will stay
My little runaway, run-run-run-run-runaway

As I walk along I wonder a-what went wrong
With our love, a love that was so strong
And as I still walk on, I think of the things we’ve done
Together, a-while our hearts were young

I'm a-walkin' in the rain
Tears are fallin' and I feel the pain
Wishin' you were here by me
To end this misery
And I wonder
I wa-wa-wa-wa-wonder
Why
Ah-why-why-why-why-why she ran away
And I wonder where she will stay
My little runaway, run-run-run-run-runaway


I sit here everyday
Looking at the sky
Ever wondering why
I dream my dreams away
And I'm living for today
In my mind's eye

Things are clearer than before
Showing me the way
Asking me to stay
I'll never close the door
To all these things and more
In my mind's eye

Everybody I know
Says I'll change, yeah
Laughing behind their hands
I think they're strange

People running everywhere
Running through my life
I couldn't give a care
Because they'll never see
All that I can see
With my mind's eye

In my mind's eye
In my mind's eye


When the children play
You're so far away
Playing had no meaning for so long

When they're old and gray
They'll hide their minds away
Living for the dawn of tomorrow

Why do birds fly high
Straight up to the sky?
Can't feel alive
Do you see me?

What else will I see in you?
You must live your dreams
Can't you feel me?

So in love
Tomorrow
See me
Feel me


That man, is he still my friend?
That man, with the wild eye
That man, and his journey's end
Mirror, can't tell tell me any lies

That man, with the weary look
That man, is he a living book?
Mirror, can't tell me any lies

That man
That man

Mirror, can't tell me any lies
Mirror, can't tell me any...


I've been told it's just a matter of time
Before you meet someone who'll open your mind
But time's on my side and nevertheless
I know the pain of too much tenderness

It's all part of my way of giving
And I'm giving it all to you
More than love it's a way of living
So what more would you have me do

Although I'm not a guy who means to hurt
And if at times it seems our love won't work
I tell you honey, you must realise
And see confusion in my rounded eyes

It's all part of my way of giving
And I'm giving it all to you
More than love it's a way of living
And it's me that you're looking through


Girl, hold my hand (hand)
Girl, I know you'll understand (stand)
That I've been waiting for a long long time
Think everything's gonna turn out fine

Hey! Hey! It's alright
Hey! Hey! It's alright
Hey! Hey! My my my
Hey! Hey! Yeh yeh yeh

Girl, treat me kind (kind)
And girl, I think you'll find (find)
That no-one can love you better than me
Close your eyes and I think you'll see

Hey! Hey! It's alright
Hey! Hey! My my my
Hey! Hey! Come on children
Hey! Hey! My oh my

When I think of what I've missed
It makes me laugh inside
All the girls that I ain't kissed
Just to keep my pride Yeh yeh yeh yeh

So girl, look around (round)
And girl, see what we've found (found)
We've found something we can't fight
Don't think twice it'll be alright now

Hey! Hey! It's alright
Hey! Hey! I said my my my yeh
Hey! Hey! Yeh It's alright
Hey! (Yeh!) Hey! Yeh! It's alright
Hey! (Hey!) Hey! Hey! It's alright
Hey! (Yeh!) Hey! Yeh! It's alright
Hey! (Aw!) Hey! Ooh! It's alright
Hey! (Ooh!) Hey! Yeh! It's alright
Hey! (C'mon!) Hey! Shake your head
Hey! (Alright) Hey! I promise that
Hey! (Yeh!) Hey! Oh it's alright
Hey! (everybody) Hey! It's alright when I say
Hey! Hey! Alright, alright, alright
Hey! Hey! (fade)


I've a feeling that I know you (hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey)
Tell me have you ever seen me (hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey)
I hear, I see, have you seen me?
Through it all I've been here without you (hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey)
Tell me have you ever seen me (hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey)

Words seem out of place, all my life I've known your face
Have you ever seen me, have you ever seen me?

Many flowers are breaking through the concrete (hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey)
Listen everybody I can hear them breathing (hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey)
I hear, I see, have you seen me?
I felt I got a feeling that I know you (hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey)
I got to know have you ever seen me (hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey)

The light in your eyes has faded
And your voice has another tone
I have cried all my tears already
Once again I am all alone

I got something I want to tell you
I got something I want to say
I got something I want to tell you
I got something I want to say


I know that I can be lonely
So stay with me, don't play with me
Don't blow out everything
You've got to know how I feel
It's my Achilles heel, feeling lonely

Things never change, but they weaken
And I can't be, green memory
I've got to feel your smile
I feel that I am part of a wheel
It's my Achilles heel, feeling lonely


Things are going to get better
Times change, better later than never
Being true to myself
Makes me see all the more

Things are going to get better
Times fly, so don't you upset her
And I know how I feel
And it's time for a change

Things are going to get better
I said I knew it, I want to tell everybody
The moment that I met her
And it seems that my mind
Has survived on its own
Things are going to get better


I've been told it's just a matter of time
Before you meet someone who'll open your mind
But time's on my side and nevertheless
I know the pain of too much tenderness

It's all part of my way of giving
And I'm giving it all to you
More than love it's a way of living
So what more would you have me do

Although I'm not a guy who means to hurt
And if at times it seems our love won't work
I tell you honey, you must realise
And see confusion in my rounded eyes

It's all part of my way of giving
And I'm giving it all to you
More than love it's a way of living
And it's me that you're looking through


And with the rain a stranger came
His eyes were filled with love and pain
He eat and slept and darkness fell
And in his sleep his mind did tell of
Green circles (circles of)
Green circles

He dreamt of circles in the air
And in his heart and everywhere
He wanted all the world to be
As free as he so they could see those
Green circles (circles of)
Green circles

His face was worn
The lines they told
The dust and patience of his load
As with the dawn he went his way
And with him went his love and pain
And green circles (circles of)
Green circles

Green circles, green circles, green circles
Green circles, green circles, green circles
Green circles, green circles

Green circles (circles of)
Green circles (circles of)
Green circles (circles of)
Green circles (circles of)
Green circles (circles of)
Green circles (circles of)
Green circles (circles of)
Green circles


If I could find a way, would I become like you, yeah?
If I could throw myself away, would I become like you?
Would I know just where I stood?
Would my heart be made out of wood?

If I could be a brick, would I become like you, yeah?
If I could give my best friend a kick, would I become like you?
Would I know just where I was at?
Would my brains be where I sat?
Would I become like you?

(Hello, they're playing it again!)


I know that you miss him
I can tell by the way you kiss him
Get yourself together girl, all right

You say that you love him
But now he's gone so please forget him
Get yourself together girl, all right

I'm just like you, so take my heed
You see me as a friend or a friend in need
Just get yourself together

So if you feel that you need me
I'm here beside you, can't you see me?
Get yourself together and it'll be all right


And now for your delight,
The darling of Wapping Wharf laundrette,
Ronald Leafy a-Lane!

I just ain't sure, what she said you know
I just ain't sure, I know I've been a fool
I know I've got to wake, own up, I've been hung up

All the time I knew
I knew her love it just weren't true
I know I've been a fool
She took me for a green up, shake up
Knew we'd break up

Fell from out the sky, thought she was mine
Freckles on her nose, cute Miss Sunshine

It had to be this way
Sun clouded and the sky was grey
And when she went away
I knew she wouldn't come back
Look back, she'd get sidetracked

Fell from out the sky, thought she was mine
Freckles on her nose, cute Miss Sunshine


Listen, it's been three months
Since I was last with you
So many people tryin' to
Stop me getting through

The doorman he just laughed
But I don't want no autograph
Now you listen to me baby

All I want to do
Is talk to you

You know I didn't stop you doing
Things you wanted to do
But now it's gone too far
It looks like I'm losing you

But I don't want sympathy
But please don't turn your back on me
Listen baby

All I want to do
Is talk to you

I got to talk to you
I got to try to make you see
Just how very very much
You mean to me

Would it be too much
To try and jog your memory
You remember me baby
I hope that I'm still
Part of your history

Now I don't wanna share your car
No no no, or stop you being a star
All I want to, all I wanna do
You know what I've gotta to do
Got to keep on trying


I've been walking with dawn
For my sleep hath been torn
And my happiness gone
There's an old man in me
Who I talk to you see
He's as old as the sun

Want to know just what I've been saying
Please, please, show me the way

Want to know just what I've been saying
Please, please, show me the way

All the truth I have known
Has been scattered and blown
I don't know who I am

Someone else's part I am playing
Please, please, show me the way


When you're slipping into sleep, that's the time to unwind
Sinking down into the deep, that's the time of no time
When you're slipping into sleep
All the sounds around you seem to have a new meaning
Leave your body behind you with a different feeling
When you're slipping into sleep

The day is night, the night is day
So please out the light as I slip away
Up the wooden hills to Bedfordshire
Up the wooden hills to Bedfordshire

When you're slipping into sleep, there's a world you will find
That's all yours and you can keep, that's the only thing to keep
When you're slipping into sleep
All the sounds around you seem to have a new meaning
Leave your body behind you with a different feeling
When you're slipping into sleep


I see the sunshine, the sunshine sees me
I feel the breezes off of the sea
The palm trees are waving
The sand is so warm
But I'm only dreaming
I'm dreaming alone

Eddie's dreaming (always dreaming)
Eddie's dreaming (always dreaming)

I'm eating banana, my friends sit around
I tell them my stories
They won't make a sound
The girls they'll be dancing
To the beat of the foam
I'll smoke and I'll watch them
When I'm back home


Here come the nice lookin' so good
He makes me feel like no one else could
He knows what I want, he's got what I need
He's always there if I need some sweet

Here come the nice (It's understood)
Here come the nice (He'll make you feel so good)
I'd be just like him (If I only could)
You know you should

You know you should meet the man
The man gonna help you all he can
You don't need money to be wise

Here come the nice (It's understood)
Here come the nice (He makes me feel so good)
I'd be just like him (If only could)
You know you should

Here come the nice lookin' so cool
Everyone knows the nice is no fool
He'll bring you up and show you around
He's always there when your feet hit the ground

Here come the nice (It's understood)
Here come the nice (God he makes me feel good)
I'd be just like him (If I only could)
You know you should

You know you got to try to meet the man
This man's gonna teach you all he can
Ha! You don't need money (Money)
Money to open your eyes

Here come the nice (It's understood)
Here come the nice (God, he makes me feel good)
I'd be just like him (If I only could)

Here come the nice (Oh baby, baby, baby)
Here come the nice (Here come the nice)
I'd be just like him (If I only could)
You know you should


Over Bridge of Sighs
To rest my eyes in shades of green
Under dreaming spires
To Itchycoo Park, that's where I've been

(What did you do there?) I got high
(What did you feel there?) Well, I cried
(But why the tears there?) Tell you why
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful

I feel inclined to blow my mind
Get hung up, feed the ducks with a bun
They all come out to groove about
Be nice and have fun in the sun

I'll tell you what I'll do (What will you do?)
I'd like to go there now with you
You can miss out school (Won't that be cool?)
Why go to learn the words of fools?

(What will we do there?) We'll get high
(What will we touch there?) We'll touch the sky
(But why the tears there?) I'll tell you why
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful

I feel inclined to blow my mind
Get hung up, feed the ducks with a bun
They all come out to groove about
Be nice and have fun in the sun

It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
Ha

It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful


If the smile on my face
Doesn't mean much any more
Then it's all been just a waste of time
So won't you close your door
But when I look into your eyes
I feel there's still something there
And something's all I need to hold on to
I can lie to myself

I still care
I still care about the way...
And the little things you say
Won't you please come out to play

I'm only dreaming

What good does dreaming do
When you're nowhere?
I got nobody to hold on to
But I keep on smiling, crying

See me walking down the street
Just turn your head and walk away
'Cause by now you ought to know how I feel
And there's no more

I'm only dreaming
I'm only dreaming


I am a little tin soldier
That wants to jump into your fire
You are a look in your eye
A dream passing by in the sky

I don't understand
All I need is treat me like a man
'Cause I ain't no child
Take me like I am

I got to know that I belong to you
Do anything that you want to do
Sing any song that you want me to sing to you

I don't need no aggravation
I just got to make you
I just got to make you my occupation

I got to know that I belong to you
Do anything that you want to do
Sing any song that you want me to sing to you

All I need is your whispered hello
Smiles melting the snow nothing heard
Your eyes are deeper than time
Say a love that won't rhyme without words

So now I've lost my way
I need help to show me things to say
Give me your love before mine fades away

I got to know that I belong to you
Do anything that you want to do
Sing any song that you want me to sing to you

Oh no no
I just want some reaction
Someone to give me satisfaction
All I want to do is stick with you
'Cause I love you


Easy and lazy we go
It seems so hazy and slow

(Shoop shoop duweddy weddy)
Long before the long before we know
(Shanga langa langa dulang)
Times were so high they were low

I'm only writing the rhyme
Don't find me taking my time
Please pass me my glass of wine
I feel much better
I feel much better
I feel much

(Shoop shoop duweddy weddy)
(Shoop shoop duweddy weddy)
Please feel aat home to come and go
(Shanga langa langa dulang)
Easy and lazy and slow
(Shoop shoop duweddy weddy)
Smiling so nicely to know
(Shanga langa langa dulang)
Winds of good fortune must blow your way

These things won't come in a day
These things are coming to stay
There's really not much to say
I feel much better
I feel much better
I feel much

(Shoop shoop duweddy weddy)
Slowly


I'm happy just to be with you
And loving you the way I do
It's everything I need to know
Just resting in the afterglow of your...

Love, love is all around me
Everywhere
Love has come to touch my soul
With someone who really cares
No one can deny us
People who once passed me by
Will turn their heads 'round

I'm happy just to be with you
And loving you the way I do, yeah
It's everything I need to know
Just resting in the afterglow of your love

You
Yes you have always been here
Feeling deep inside
A feeling that I could not see
Or touch, or try to hide
My love is in and around you
I bless the day that I found you
So listen up baby

I'm happy just to be with you
And loving you the way I do, yeah
It's everything I need to know
Just resting in the afterglow of your love

Love is like a voice in my head
Keeps turning 'round the things that we said

I'm happy just to be with you
And loving you the way I do, yeah
It's everything I need to know
Just resting in the afterglow of your love


Please don't ask me how I know
The times before I met you long ago
If I could sit quite still
And times could pass me by
I'd sit quite still and pass the time
I'd have with you

A summer evening touches everywhere

Just like before, we'll meet again
When we can think of long agos and worlds apart
That were and are no more


There she is parading on the quayside
You can find her every night
Ah, waiting for a stevedore from Tyneside -
Why it's Rene, the docker's delight!

Well, if you just got off an oil tanker
And you've got the readies in the bin
Just make your way down to The Crown and Anchor
Ask for Rene (oh, hello ducks!) and you'll be well in

She's Rene, the docker's delight
And a ship's in every night
Groping with a stoker from the coast of Kuala Lumpur

Love is like an 'ole in the wall
A line-up in the warehouse no trouble at all
If you can spare the money, you'll have a ball -
She'll have yours

Well, there's a kid of every shape and colour
Safely hid in coal-shed double locked
Well it's been said that Rene is the mother
I wonder - well, there you go!

She's Rene, the docker's delight
And a ship's in every night
Groping with a stoker from the coast of Kuala Lumpur


There's wheat in the field
And water in the stream
And salt in the mine
And an aching in me

I can no longer stand and wonder
'Cause I'm driven by this hunger

So I'll jug some water, bake some flour
Store some salt and wait the hour

When thinking of love
Love is thinking for me
And the baker will come
And the baker I'll be

I'm depending on my labour
The texture and the flavour

Hey

I can no longer stand and wonder
'Cause I'm driven by this hunger

So I'll jug some water, bake some flour
Store some salt and wait the hour


Wouldn't it be nice, to get on with me neighbours
But they make it very clear, they've got no room for ravers
They stop me from groovin', they bang on me wall
They're doing me crust in, it's no good at all, ah!

Lazy Sunday afternoon
I've got no mind to worry
Close my eyes and drift away

'Ere we all are, sitting in a rainbow
Gor blimey hello Mrs Jones, how's your Bert's lumbago? (mustn't grumble)
I'll sing you a song with no words and no tune
To sing in your khazi while you suss out the moon, oh yeah!

Lazy Sunday afternoon
I've got no mind to worry
Close my eyes and drift away

Roo dee doo dee doo, roo dee doo dee die day
Roo dee doo dee dum, roo dee doo dee doo dee

There's no one to hear me, there's nothing to say
And no one can stop me, from feeling this way, yeah

Lazy Sunday afternoon
I've got no mind to worry
Close my eyes and drift away

Lazy Sunday afternoon
I've got no mind to worry
Close my eyes and drift a-
Close my mind and drift away
Close my eyes and drift away


"Are you all sitting comftybold two square on your botty? Then I'll begin ..."

Once upon a time in a land of greens
Where the sky was silky soft
And full of colored dreams
Deep inside a rainbow
Lived Happiness Stan
In a small Victoriana charabanc

Evening will be here quite soon
Stan can sit and watch the moon
Watching as the white light
Slowly makes the night bright
Hours slipping by while time stands still

Think of black and black will think of you
It's covered Stan in bruises
Of the darkness that we knew
For black had stolen half the moon away


Goodbye sunshine
I'm on my way
I'll be long time gone
By the break of day

Tell everyone
That I'm gonna find it
There ain't nothin'
Gonna stop me -

Rollin' over,
Rollin' over

Save all your lovin'
Till I get home
To the sweetest lovin' sunshine
That I've ever known

Tell everyone
That I'm gonna find it
There ain't nothin'
Gonna stop me

Rollin' over, Shak-do-way
Rollin' over, Yeah-yeah-yeah

Rollin' over, Shak-do-way
Rollin' over, Yeah-yeah-yeah

Rollin' over, Shak-do-way
Rollin' over, Yeah-yeah-yeah

Rollin' over, Shak-do-way
Rollin' over, Yeah-yeah-yeah


Here am I tiny fly
May I share your Shepherd's Pie?

What is this strange voice I hear?

Here I am look this way
In the landscape on your tray

There's no need to ask a silly question
If I were you I hope you'd do the same
There's no doubt I'd help a hungry fly out
To see you in a fix it's really such a shame

I'm so hungry, I could die
And now I'll be a living fly

My name is Stan
I'm on a quest
Take your fill
Take nothing less

I am that, that am I
And now I'll be a living fly


If tomorrow was today
It would be yesterday
The sun is surely just a thought away
Where visions that men fail
To put to words to tale
And music that they try but cannot play

You're right it's just a dream
Your company so kind
Hold very tightly please
And we shall go out


There was an old man who lived in the greenwood
Nobody knew him or what he had done
But mothers would say to their children, "Beware of Mad John."

John would sing with the birds in the morning
Laugh with the wind in the cold end of night
But people from behind their curtains, said he's not quite right

John had it sussed he was living the life of a tramp
Yes his bed was the cold and the damp but the sun was his friend
He was free

So here was a wise one who loved all the haters
He loved them so much that their hate turned to fear
And shaking from behind their curtains the loved ones would hear


Life is just a bowl of All-Bran
You wake up every morning and it's there
So live as only you can
It's all about enjoy it 'cause ever since you saw it
There ain't no one can take it away

So life is just a bowl of All-Bran - very true!
What you say has made it very clear
To be sure I'll live as best as I can
But how can I remember to keep it all together
When half the moon is taken away?

Well, I've got the very thing
If you can laugh and sing
Give me those happy days toytown newspaper smiles
Clap twice, lean back, twist for a while
When you're untogether and feeling out of tune
Sing this special song with me, don't worry 'bout the moon
Looks after itself

Can I have a go?
Yes
Yeah?
Sing now:

Give me those happy days toytown newspaper smile
Clap twice, lean back, twist for a while
Well now you've got the hang of it
There's nothing you can't do with it
If you're very tuned to it you can't go wrong.

All together!

Give me those happy days toytown newspaper smile
Clap twice, lean back, twist for a while
Well now we've got the hang of it
There's nothing we can't do with it
And now we're very into it we can't go wrong!

Give me those happy days toytown newspaper smile
Clap twice, lean back, twist for a while
Well now we've got the hang of it
There's nothing we can't do with it
And now we're very into it we can't go wrong!
