I'm not talking
Well that's what I got to say
If I said things were splendid
Our mom might be offended
If I said things were awful
It may just be unlawful
That's one thing I can do without

I'm not talking
Well that's what I got to say
Used to think I knew it
Man I sure outgrew it
Things like idle chatter
Ain't the things that matter
Don't call me baby, I'll call you

I'm not talking
Well that's what I got to say
If I said things at midnight
I ain't gonna say 'em in daylight
I reached the final conclusion
And all this persecution
Don't call me, baby, I'll call you


You say hop and I'll hop,
You say stop and I'll stop,

Putty in your hands ah-ah,

Or cut me down to the size of a rubber ball.
You can use me, abuse me, but never remove me,
Without your love I ain't nothing at all.
Oh well ah.

They say I'm a fool,
'Cos you treat me so cruel,
But I'll go on this way.
Oh anything you say I'm like a hunk of clay.

Can you judge a man by the way he wears his hair?
Can you read his mind by the clothes that he wears?
Can you see a bad man by the pattern on his tie?

Well thenMisterMr, you're a better man than I
Yeah, Mister, you're a better man than I
Oh, Mister, you're a better man than I
Yeah, Mister, you're a better man than I

Could you tell a wise man by the way he speaks or spells?
Is this more important than the stories that he tells?
And call a man a fool if for wealth he doesn't strive?

Yeah, Mister, you're a better man than I
Oh, Mister, you're a better man than I
Yeah, Mister, you're a better man than I

Oh, Mister, you're a better man than I

Evil hearted you.
You always try to put me down,
With the things you do,
And words,
You spread around against me.

Evil hearted you.
You kept,
Kidding me along,
With your phoney smile,
And with,
Your siren song smiling, beguiling,
You lead me on 'til all hope's gone,
Persuading, degrading,
On my knees I try to please.

But I love you,
Just the same,
And I want you,
To remain,
By my side,
And you'll see,
Just how much you,
Mean to me.

Evil hearted you.
You always try to put me down,
With the things you do,
And words,
You spread around against me,
About me.
What would you,
Do without me?
Smiling, beguiling,
You lead me on 'til all hope has gone.


Now when I was a little boy,
At the age of five,
I had somethin' in my pocket,
Kept a lot of folks alive.
Now I'm a man,

All you pretty women,
Stand in line,
I can make love to you baby,
In an hour's time.
Now I'm a man

Will never miss,
Make love to you baby,
You can't resist.

To Kansas to,
Bring back a little girl,
Just like you.

Made twenty-one,
You know baby,
We can have a lot of fun.
I'm a man,

See the stars come falling down from the sky
Gently passing, they kiss your tears when you cry
See the wind of summer blow your hair upon your head
See the rain, the falling rain, it's rain

Still I'm sad

Oh my flowers, my tears just falling two days
We are driving the night to find they are lost
Flower, flower the wind is blowing, time into my heart
When the wind blows hard, we are apart

Still I'm sad
Still I'm sad

Still I'm sad


Sick at heart and lonely,
Deep in dark despair.
Thinking one thought only
Where is she tell me where.
And if she says to you
She don't love me
Just give her my message
Tell her of my plea

And I know if she had me back again
Well I would never make her sad.
I've gotta heart full of soul.

She's been gone such a long time
Longer than I can bear
But if she says she wants me
Tell her that I'll be there
And if she says to you
She don't love me
Just give her my message
Tell her of my plea.


Aboard a train

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Cars and girls are easy come by in this day and age,
Laughing, joking, drinking, smoking,

All the things they said were wrong,
Are what I want to be.

I can't make your way.
Silly men, they all get worried,
Live their life so worthlessly,
Troubled, bothered, flustered, hurried,
They should take a look at me.
Taxman, rentman, they all chase me,
I ain't home when they come round.
Got no money, live my life free,
That's the best way, I have found.

I can't make your way.
I can't make your way.

I can't make your way.
Is that me I hear you calling?

It ain't me that will be falling,
Ten years time, I'll be the same.

The devil ever made

Now I know you, baby

Now I know you, baby
You'll find no new guy
I know baby
I sure ain't blind


Looking at the world around,
For the very first time.
Never seen it all before,
Hope it's not all mine.

On Monday morning all alone,
I woke within my house of stone.
I ventured forth unto the day,
These things I saw upon my way.

Trees and flowers were wrapped around,
With people's castoffs on the ground.
Roads and noise of glass and steel,
And people snared within the wheel.

Tuesday looked into the sky,
Where birds in peace were left to fly.
Thunder rolled and lightning flashed,
I watched the world as people dashed.

Friday's sadness began to creep,
Upon me like the deepest sleep.
It seemed that only I could see,
Just what my world would finally be.

On Sunday back inside my room,
I draw the blinds, 'tis afternoon.
I let my mind find its own ways,
Farewell to future days.


You're looking my way,
That's good to see.
Well how I'm thinking,
Is it really me.
You'll give me something,
That (lights up all[?])
It can't be just my,
My eyes you call.

I'd like to get to know you, sure,
And take this thing just one step more,
And find out just what it's all for,
But he's always there.

You're fixing my eyes,
With a constant gaze.
It could really have me,
In an utter daze.
Come a little closer,
He's not to see,
There's something going,
Between you and me.

I'd like to get to know you, sure,
And take this thing just one step more,
And find out just what it's all for,
But he's always there.

I'd like to get to know you, sure,
And take this thing just one step more,
And find out just what it's all for,

He's always there.
He's always there.
He's always there.

Ah-ah-ah...

How your restless hungry eyes,
Speak of cloudy summer skies.
The morning dew,
Turns into rain,
Lonely winds will call my name.

Dying leaves of seasons brown,
Losing life as they drift down.
Too soon in life,
Return to earth,
Only they can know their worth.

Distant dreams of things to be,
Wandering thoughts that can't be free.
I feel my mind,
Turning away,
To the darkness of my day.


I want somebody here to tell me why,
There's always smoke up in the sky.
Please don't make me want to cry,
Detail has not been seen.
Summer trees should all be green,
Plain and green as they have been,
Sun don't ever change the scene,
Please never let them die.

What do you want?
What do you want?
What do you want?
What do you want?

Sounds which soar above my ears,
Will naturally precede in years,
They only cause a flood of tears,
I want to turn and run.
Don't need someone to make my fun,
Only need to see the sun,
I will not go and cause harm,
I cannot think that way.

What do you want?
What do you want?
What do you want?
What do you want?

Sit spellbound by a flickering screen,
Watch the ever changing scenes,
Listen to the rising screams,
Of children of today.
Lock your doors and stay within,
Upon your face the stupid grins,
Penalty for unrealized sins,
Committed on your way.

What do you want?
What do you want?
What do you want?
What do you want?

What do you want?
What do you want?

Ever since the world began,
Satan's followed every man.
Trapping evil if he can,
I tell you now his greatest plan.
Invented when I cannot tell,
Defied the thoughts of man so well.
Man wants money for his need,
But soon it sows its evil seed.
Unhappiness it only brings,
As man wants more and better things.
If not enough the evil lies,
But soon you'll find somebody dies.
Throughout the years there have been wars,
Power and richness have been the cause.
Trapped in money's evil net,
Man wants more than he can get.

You don't need money.
No, no, no, no,
You don't need money.
No, no, no, no,
You don't need money.
...[etc.]

It'll never bring you love,
No more than the sun above.
You'll never see the end,
The money you will surely spend.
But ask for help if you sin,
Reclaim yourself, what a state you're in.
The devil has you in his grasp,
There ain't no mercy you can ask.
More and more you will need,
You're strangled in the clutch of greed.
You can't get out, no place to go,
You sold your soul - the answer's no!


Little games are for little boys,
I'm growing up and changing all my toys,
Aeroplanes, motor cars, goldfish in old jam-jars,
I just don't play these games no more.
Little games are for little boys,
Loving games are for bigger boys,
Parties in Chelsea flats,
Mixing with kinky cats,
Are games I wanna play some more.

Ooh, what they're doing to me,
Darling it's so plain to see,
My temperature's rising,
But that's not surprising,
When you do what you do to me.

Little games are for little boys,
I found out there are other joys,
Marjory, Josephine, Susie and Catherine,
They help me in my little games.

Say I need you, I need you...


Smile on me baby,
Make me feel like summer's here.
Smile on me baby,
Make me feel good when you're near.
Prove it to me baby,
That our love is in the clear.

Walk with me baby,
Make me hold my head up high.
Walk with me baby,
Make me feel the greatest guy.
I'm gonna love you baby,
Love you till you cry.

Stay with me baby,
Make me always feel so fine.
Stay with me baby,
Make me always feel so fine,
So I can tell all the world,
You always gonna be mine.

Tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor,
Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief,

How can I know just what to be?
Please stop and give advice to me.
Tell me,

How many people do I help,
Just by sitting on the shelf,
Tell me,
Tell me,
I don't want a trade at all,

Then they will say that I am true.
Maybe,

Perhaps I'll come to a great success,
Or possible a dreadful mess.

Living's just a little game.

Glimpses of clouds in a forest,
Can review well within us,
And to never linger on one is life,
Energy radiates from the source,
The life around us is but a reflection of our own,
Flowing within never-ending boundless infinity,
Time is just a cumular limit,
Which with one glimpse can overcome,
Can overcome,
Can overcome,
Can overcome,
Can overcome,
Can overcome,
Can overcome.


Ah, ah, ah, ah...
Well I've been running and a-hiding,
Trying to lose my mind.
Well I've been running and a-hiding,
Trying to lose my mind.
Ever since you told me,
That you weren't my kind.

Ah, ah, ah...
Drinking muddy water,
I don't know how long for.
I been drinking muddy water,
I don't know how long for.
Since I been running, babe,
I been treating you like a dog.


I'm moving,
I'm gonna see the world while I can.
I'm moving,
I'm gonna be a well rounded man.
And there ain't no room for no-one else,
I've got to learn it all for myself.

No excess baggage,
- There to worry me.
No excess baggage,
- There to hurry me.
No excess baggage, girl,
I must roam,
All alone,
On my own,

I'm hungry,
I wanna taste the fruits of the world.
So hungry,
And assure I do love you girl.
But if you're what I'm searching for,
My heart will lead me back to your door.

Stealin', stealin',
Mama, don't ya tell on me,
I'm stealing back to the way I used to be.

Well, put your arms around me,
Like a circle round the sun,
Now (they's got the blue [?])
We can have a little fun,
How glad it's you,
And not your sister with me now,
Saw her yesterday,
And she look's just like a...

Stealin', stealin,
Mama, don't ya tell on me,
I'm stealing back to the way I used to be.

I'm stealin', stealin,
Mama, don't ya tell on me,
I'm stealing back to the way I used to be.

Well, sit beside me baby,
[?]
The sun is shining out now,
Just for you and I,
Look, I mean to walk you home,
Your mama's getting bad,
So I'd rather stay at home.

Stealin', stealin,
Mama, don't ya tell on me,
I'm stealing back to the way I used to be.

Gone, gone away,
Gone away,
Almost nothing to do.
Gone away,
Now I'm far from you,
Though I'm alone now,
And there's nobody near,
I hush my voice,
Lest they should hear;
My prayers go up to the sky,
Deep within me I die,
I'll never cry,
No-one must see me this way.

Left, left to find,
Someone kind,
Who won't leave me behind,
Who will guide me,
When I am blind;
Soothe my brow,
When thoughts hurt my brain;
Help me love,
When faced with pain.
I long to find someone who,
Will remind me of you,
Only the black rose knows what I will do.

Silence, silence now,
Not a sound,
Stillness everywhere now,
And the trees,
To the wind gently bow,
Only visions of the past and the gloom,
And for the moment you're in the room,
And just as flowers bloom and die,
No-one watching to cry,
Only the black rose stands up to the sky.
Only the black rose stands up to the sky.
Only the black rose.


Little wooden soldier boy,
How he's bored to be a toy.
Sitting on the mantelpiece,
Was not his idea of peace.
So one night at half past one,
He ordered all the toys to come.
He told them all a good game to play,
Next day.

The teddy bears and wind-up toys,
Together made a lot of noise.
The other side formed into ranks,
Proud 'cause they had plastic tanks.
High up on the shelf to see,
The soldier had to jump with glee.
At last before his eyes he saw,
A real war.

With a battle raging on the floor,
The soldier boy was urging more.
Soon the floor was strewn with bits,
Fur and stuff and building kits.
The soldier boy was feeling high,
As smoke clouds rolled across the sky.
He gave a last triumphant cry,
And fell into the fire.
